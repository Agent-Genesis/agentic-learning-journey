## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement

Claude Code lacks native task management capabilities beyond session-based TodoWrite tracking. This creates significant inefficiencies in managing persistent projects, collaborating on tasks, and maintaining continuity between development sessions. Current limitations include:

- No persistent task storage across sessions
- No collaboration or assignment capabilities
- No real-time task synchronization
- Limited task management features (no priorities, dependencies, deadlines)
- No integration with external productivity tools

### Proposed Solution

Deploy and integrate the Convex fullstack task management application as a comprehensive task management backend, with seamless API integration to Claude Code. This creates a hybrid system where:

1. **Claude Code** continues to excel at development work and conversational task tracking
2. **Convex App** provides enterprise-grade task management with persistence, collaboration, and real-time features
3. **API Integration** enables seamless data flow between both systems

### Business Value & ROI

**Immediate Benefits:**
- 100% task persistence across development sessions
- Real-time collaboration capabilities for team projects
- Professional task management interface for project oversight
- Automated task creation from development conversations

**Long-term Strategic Value:**
- Scalable task management infrastructure for growing projects
- Enhanced productivity through automated task tracking
- Better project visibility and reporting capabilities
- Foundation for additional integrations (GitHub, Jira, etc.)

**Expected ROI Timeline:**
- **Week 1:** Basic integration operational
- **Month 1:** Full workflow automation achieved
- **Quarter 1:** Productivity gains measurable (estimated 25-40% improvement)
- **Quarter 2:** Platform stable and extensible for additional features

## User Workflows & Interaction Patterns

### Daily Development Workflow

**Morning Planning:**
1. Review daily task list in Convex web interface
2. Prioritize tasks based on deadlines and dependencies
3. Start Claude Code development session
4. Claude automatically syncs with current task priorities

**Development Session:**
1. Claude Code tracks work via TodoWrite as usual
2. Significant work items automatically create Convex tasks
3. Task status updates in real-time across both systems
4. Progress automatically logged and time-tracked

**Evening Review:**
1. Review completed tasks in Convex dashboard
2. Identify any tasks that need follow-up
3. Plan tomorrow's priorities
4. Generate progress reports

### Collaboration Workflow

**Multi-Project Management:**
1. Create separate Convex projects for different initiatives
2. Assign tasks to specific team members or roles
3. Track dependencies between tasks across projects
4. Monitor overall project progress and bottlenecks

**Client/ Stakeholder Communication:**
1. Share Convex task boards with external stakeholders
2. Generate progress reports for client updates
3. Track time and budget against project estimates
4. Maintain audit trail of all changes and decisions

### Task Creation Patterns

**From Development Conversations:**
```
User: "I need to implement user authentication for the API"
Claude: Automatically creates Convex task:
- Title: "Implement user authentication for API"
- Description: "Add JWT-based authentication to REST endpoints"
- Priority: High
- Category: Backend Development
- Assigned to: Current user
```

**From Code Commits:**
```
Commit: "Fix memory leak in data processing module"
Claude: Automatically updates related Convex task:
- Status: In Progress → Completed
- Time logged: Actual development time
- Notes: "Memory leak resolved, tested under load"
```

task:assigned        # Task assigned to user
task:commented       # New comment added
project:updated      # Project details changed
```

### Data Models

**Task Model:**
```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  status: 'todo' | 'in_progress' | 'review' | 'completed';
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'urgent';
  assignedTo: string | null;
  createdBy: string;
  projectId: string;
  dueDate: Date | null;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  comments: Comment[];
  attachments: Attachment[];
  timeTracking: TimeEntry[];
  dependencies: string[]; // Task IDs
  tags: string[];
  estimatedHours: number | null;
  actualHours: number;
}
```

**Project Model:**
```typescript
interface Project {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  status: 'active' | 'completed' | 'archived';
  ownerId: string;
  members: ProjectMember[];
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  settings: ProjectSettings;
}
```

**Integration Settings Model:**
```typescript
interface IntegrationSettings {
  autoCreateTasks: boolean;
  syncFromTodoWrite: boolean;
  timeTrackingEnabled: boolean;
  notificationPreferences: NotificationSettings;
  taskTemplates: TaskTemplate[];
  workflowRules: WorkflowRule[];
}
```

### Authentication & Security

**Authentication Flow:**
1. Claude Code obtains API token via OAuth2 flow with Convex
2. Token stored securely in environment configuration
3. Token refresh handled automatically by integration client
4. All API calls include proper authentication headers

**Security Measures:**
- API tokens encrypted at rest
- Rate limiting implemented on all endpoints
- HTTPS required for all communications
- Audit logging for all task operations
- Role-based access control for project permissions

### Error Handling Strategy

**API Error Responses:**
```typescript
interface APIError {
  code: string;
  message: string;
  details: any;
  timestamp: Date;
  requestId: string;
}
```

**Retry Logic:**
- Exponential backoff for transient failures
- Maximum 3 retry attempts per operation
- Circuit breaker pattern for service availability
- Graceful degradation when Convex unavailable

**Data Consistency:**
- Eventual consistency for task synchronization
- Conflict resolution using last-write-wins with timestamps
- Manual conflict resolution interface for critical discrepancies
