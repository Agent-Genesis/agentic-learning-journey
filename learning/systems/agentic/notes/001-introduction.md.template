# Notes - Lesson 001: Hello Agentic Coding

## üìñ Lesson Summary

**Date**: October 21, 2025
**Participants**: ${USER_NAME} & ${MAIN_AGENT_NAME}
**Status**: Currently reading

## üí° Key Concepts Understood

### 1. The Agentic Revolution (Phase 2)
- **Phase 1**: AI Coding - Use AI to generate code
- **Phase 2**: Agentic Coding - Build systems that build systems
- **The change**: Move from "coding" to "commanding compute"

### 2. "Stop Coding" Mindset üö´
> "Your hands and mind are no longer the best tool for the job of writing code"

**Why?**
- LLMs with right agent architecture on supercomputers are better coders
- Our value: Planning, Review, Creating closed loops
- If we still type code, we can't keep up

### 3. New Engineer Role (Phase 2)
- **Allocation**: Engineering cycles on planning & reviewing
- **Focus**: Closed loop structures
- **Importance**: Code understanding still critical, but we don't code anymore

### 4. Commander of Compute
- Transform codebase into "self-operating machine"
- Maximize leverage so codebase runs itself
- Move from "coding" to "designing systems that code"

## üéØ Personal Objective: Become Irreplaceable

**TAC Mission**: Transform to become an engineer they can't replace
- Target: Boss, company, industry, AI
- Means: 10X, 100X leverage through agentic systems
- Reason: Engineering was never about writing code

## üîÑ Questions & Reflections

### ${USER_NAME}'s Questions:
1. How to practically apply "Stop Coding" in daily life?
2. Which agent tools to start with?
3. How to measure progression toward this new role?

### Claude's Reflections:
1. This change requires complete reprogramming of our habits
2. Value shifts from execution to design and supervision
3. We need to develop new productivity metrics

## üìù Next Actions

- [ ] Finish reading lesson 001 completely
- [ ] Identify practical exercises
- [ ] Start first simple agentic project
- [ ] Document our first steps without writing code
