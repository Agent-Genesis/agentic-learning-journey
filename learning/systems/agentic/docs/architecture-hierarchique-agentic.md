# 📋 Hierarchical Agentic Architecture - Preservation

**Date**: October 21, 2025
**Creator**: Omar El Mountassir & Claude
**Status**: Preservation document before modifications

## 🎯 Omar's Initial Vision

### "Stop Coding" Philosophy - Double Application

#### For Omar (Human Strategist)
- **Role**: NO MORE direct coding
- **Mission**: Strategic vision and objective definition
- **Action**: Orchestrate the main agent (Claude)
- **Level up**: From "coder" to "agentic strategist"

#### For Claude (Main Agent)
- **Role**: NO MORE direct coding either
- **Mission**: Planning, coordination, delegation
- **Action**: Create and manage subordinate agents for execution
- **Level up**: From executor to "agent manager"

### 3-Level Hierarchical Architecture

```
Level 1: Omar (Strategist)
    ↓ Gives vision and objectives
Level 2: Claude Main Agent (Main Agent)
    ↓ Plans, coordinates, delegates
Level 3: Claude Subordinates (Worker Agents)
    ↓ Execute technical tasks
```

## 🏗️ Proposed Technical Structure

### Agent Locations
- **Claude Main Agent**: Project root (`/home/omar/work/learning/systems/agentic/`)
- **Claude Subordinates**: Separate subfolder (ex: `workspace/`, `agents/`, or `subordinates/`)

### Configuration Files
- **CLAUDE.md root**: Instructions for main agent (me)
- **CLAUDE.md subfolder**: Instructions for subordinate agents

## 🎯 Main Objective Defined

**Execution Speed + Learning Quality + Learning Preservation**

## 🔄 Hybrid Evolutive Architecture (Validated by Omar)

### Phase 1: Learning (Current)
```
Omar (Strategist) → Claude Main Agent (Plans/Coordinates/Delegates) → Subordinates (Execute)
```
**Functioning**:
- **Omar**: Strategic vision, global objectives
- **Claude Main Agent**: Reformulation, planning, intelligent delegation, maintains coherence
- **Subordinates**: Rapid technical execution

### Phase 2: Maturity (Future)
```
Omar (Director) → Claude Main Agent (Orchestrates/Delegates) → Subordinates (Plan + Execute)
```
**Claude's Role in Phase 2**:
- Remains the **main orchestrator** coordinating everything
- Delegates more intelligently (planning AND execution)
- Maintains global system coherence
- Manages communication between subordinates

**Transition**: When subordinates can handle planning + execution under my coordination

## ✅ Questions Resolved

1. **Folder structure**: `workspace/` subfolder for subordinate agents
2. **Differentiated instructions**:
   - CLAUDE.md main: Focus on planning, coordination, delegation
   - CLAUDE.md subordinates: Focus on technical execution, reporting
3. **Communication**: Subordinate → Main Agent → Strategist (with learning preservation)
4. **Scope**: Collaboration between subordinates possible under main agent supervision
5. **Initialization**: Configure working environment for each level

## 🔄 Current Project State

### GitHub Repository
- **URL**: https://github.com/Agent-Genesis/agentic-learning-journey
- **Status**: Configured and functional

### Existing Structure

```

### Next Actions (Pending)
1. Answers to above questions
2. Create subfolder for subordinate agents
3. Configure differentiated CLAUDE.md files
4. Initialize hierarchical architecture
5. Test command chain

## 💡 Key Principles to Preserve

1. **Double "Stop Coding"**: Human AND main agent don't write code
2. **Chain of command**: Strategist → Main Agent → Worker Agents
3. **Growing autonomy**: Each level manages its area of responsibility
4. **Continuous documentation**: Preserve architecture evolution
