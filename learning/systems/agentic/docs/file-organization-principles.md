# File Organization Principles

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Purpose**: Establish systematic approach to file organization and directory structure
**Scope**: All Claude Code CLI project work for Omar El Mountassir

---

## 🎯 Core Principles

### 1. Think Placement First
Before creating any file, always ask:
- **What type of content is this?**
- **What directory should contain this content?**
- **Does an appropriate directory exist?**
- **Should I create a new directory?**
- **How does this relate to existing files?**

### 2. Analyze File Context
Consider:
- **Content Type**: Documentation, scripts, configuration, data, etc.
- **Relationship**: How does this file relate to existing files?
- **Usage**: Who/what will use this file?
- **Maintenance**: How will this file be maintained over time?

### 3. Create Directories When Needed
- **Logical Grouping**: Group related files together
- **Clear Structure**: Use meaningful directory names
- **Future Growth**: Consider how the structure might evolve
- **Consistency**: Follow established naming conventions

### 4. Maintain Clean Root Directory
Keep only essential project files at root:
- **Configuration**: Project-level configs (README.md, .gitignore, etc.)
- **Entry Points**: Main application entry points
- **Core Files**: Essential project files only
- **Avoid Clutter**: Don't use root as general storage

## 🏷️ Content-Based Organization

### Tasks Directory (`tasks/`)
**Purpose**: Project management, task tracking, and workflow documentation
- `TASKS.md` - Main task management dashboard
- `scripts/` - Task-related automation scripts
- `docs/` - Task-related documentation and guides

### Documentation Directory (`docs/`)
**Purpose**: Project documentation, guides, and reference materials
- User guides and tutorials
- API documentation
- Technical specifications
- Architecture documentation

### Scripts Directory (`scripts/`)
**Purpose**: Automation scripts, utilities, and command-line tools
- Setup and installation scripts
- Build and deployment scripts
- Utility functions and helpers
- Maintenance and monitoring scripts

### Configuration Directory (`config/`)
**Purpose**: Configuration files, templates, and environment settings
- Application configuration
- Environment templates
- Deployment configurations
- Build configurations

### Source Directory (`src/`)
**Purpose**: Application source code and development files
- Main application files
- Modules and libraries
- Utilities and helpers
- Resource files

### Tests Directory (`tests/`)
**Purpose**: Test files, test data, and testing utilities
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Test data and fixtures
- Testing utilities

### Logs Directory (`logs/`)
**Purpose**: Application logs, output files, and archives
- Application logs
- Error logs
- Archived logs
- Debug output

### Reports Directory (`reports/`)
**Purpose**: Generated reports, analysis results, and metrics
- Performance reports
- Analysis results
- Status reports
- Historical data

## 🔧 Decision-Making Process

### Step 1: Content Analysis
1. **Identify file type**: What kind of content will this file contain?
2. **Determine purpose**: What is the primary purpose of this file?
3. **Consider relationships**: How does this relate to existing files?

### Step 2: Directory Evaluation
1. **Check existing directories**: Is there an appropriate existing directory?
2. **Consider new directory**: Should a new directory be created?
3. **Evaluate structure**: How will this affect the overall project structure?

### Step 3: Placement Decision
1. **Choose optimal location**: Based on content and relationships
2. **Create directory if needed**: Don't hesitate to create logical directories
3. **Consider future maintenance**: How will this placement affect long-term maintenance?

### Step 4: Validation
1. **Review decision**: Does this placement make sense?
2. **Check consistency**: Is this consistent with existing patterns?
3. **Consider alternatives**: Is there a better placement option?

## 📋 Naming Conventions

### Directory Names
- **Lowercase**: Use lowercase letters
- **Hyphens**: Use hyphens to separate words (e.g., `user-guides`)
- **Descriptive**: Use clear, descriptive names
- **Consistent**: Follow established patterns

### File Names
- **Descriptive**: Use clear, descriptive names
- **Consistent case**: Follow established patterns
- **Extensions**: Use appropriate file extensions
- **Version control**: Include version numbers when necessary

## ✅ Best Practices

### DO
- Think about file placement before creation
- Create logical directories when needed
- Group related files together
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Keep root directory clean
- Consider long-term maintenance

### DON'T
- Create files at root without consideration
- Use root directory as general storage
- Create overly deep directory structures
- Use ambiguous directory or file names
- Mix different types of content in the same directory
- Ignore existing organizational patterns

## 🔄 Maintenance Guidelines

### Regular Reviews
- **Monthly**: Review directory structure and organization
- **Quarterly**: Assess need for new directories or reorganization
- **Annually**: Comprehensive review of file organization strategy

### Cleanup Procedures
- Remove unused or obsolete files
- Consolidate scattered files when appropriate
- Update directory structures as projects evolve
- Maintain consistent organization across projects

## 🎯 Success Metrics
