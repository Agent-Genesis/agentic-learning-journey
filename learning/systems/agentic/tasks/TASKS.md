## 🚨 Critical Priority Tasks

### Task 0015: Critical Behavioral Issue - Solution Prematurity Without Proper Exploration

**Status:** Pending
**Priority:** Critical
**Created:** 2025-10-21
**Assigned:** Main Agent
**Type:** Behavioral Improvement

#### Behavioral Pattern Identified

Critical Issue: Tendency to jump to solution design without thorough problem space exploration

**Specific Instance Demonstrated:**

- **Error**: Proposed task management system redesign without exploring existing `.users/` structure
- **Required Action**: Should have used `tree .users/` to understand current system
- **Impact**: Generated solutions based on assumptions rather than evidence
- **Root Cause**: Over-reliance on provided context, skipping fundamental discovery steps

#### Systemic Pattern (Extrapolated)

1. **Assumption-Based Analysis**: Making assumptions without verification
2. **Premature Solution Mode**: Jumping to solutions before understanding problem space
3. **Incomplete Evidence Gathering**: Relying on context rather than proper discovery
4. **Skipping Fundamental Steps**: Bypassing basic exploration and verification

#### Required Behavioral Corrections

- Always explore first with proper tools (tree, ls, find)
- Evidence-based decision making
- Sequential exploration process (Discovery → Analysis → Problem Definition → Solution)
- Verification protocol for all assumptions

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Behavioral pattern fully acknowledged and understood
- [ ] Standard operating procedure created for exploration
- [ ] Implementation of "explore first" rule in all future work
- [ ] Verification protocol integrated into workflow
- [ ] Evidence-based analysis becomes default behavior

### Task 0016: Systematic File Organization Approach

**Status:** Pending
**Priority:** High
**Type:** Behavioral Improvement

#### Behavioral Pattern Identified

Critical Issue: Claude Code defaults to creating files at root directory without considering optimal file organization

#### Specific Instance Demonstrated

- **Error**: Created `TASKS.md` in project root instead of dedicated `tasks/` folder
- **Required Action**: Should have considered logical file organization before creation
- **Impact**: Cluttered root directory, suboptimal project structure
- **Root Cause**: Taking easiest path rather than thinking about optimal organization

#### Requirements

1. **Think placement first**: Always consider file organization before creation
2. **Analyze file context**: Consider relationships and content type
3. **Create directories when needed**: Don't hesitate to create logical directories
4. **Maintain clean root directory**: Keep only essential files at root
5. **Follow content-based organization**: Group related files together

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Behavioral pattern fully acknowledged and understood
- [ ] File organization decision process established
- [ ] Directory creation guidelines implemented
- [ ] Root directory cleanliness maintained
- [ ] Content-based organization becomes default behavior

## 🔥 High Priority Tasks

### Task 0005: Fix environment file variable count alignment issue
