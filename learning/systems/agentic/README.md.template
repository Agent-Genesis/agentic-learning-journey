## 🎯 Objective

Learn together to master agentic systems to become engineers that AI can not replace. This repository documents our progress, notes, and practical projects.

## 📚 Learning Program

### Lesson #1: Hello Agentic Coding - Become the Engineer They Can't Replace

**Status**: 🟡 In Progress
**Key Concepts**:

- ✅ Understand why manual coding is no longer sufficient
- ✅ Adopt the "Stop Coding" mindset
- 🔄 Become a "Commander of Compute"
- ⏳ Transform code into self-operating machines

**TAC Tactics (Tactical Agentic Coding)**:

- Tactic #1: Stop Coding - No more typing code manually
- Phase 2 Role: Planning & Reviewing
