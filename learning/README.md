## Current Status: LEARNING Phase

### What We've Done

‚úÖ **Deployed 9 specialized agents** to explore TAC course

‚úÖ **Generated 243KB of analysis** covering all 8 tactics

‚úÖ **Discovered Claude Agent SDK** enables custom Commander

‚úÖ **Created 5 architecture thinking documents** exploring options

‚úÖ **Realized we're in LEARNING phase**, not development

### What We're Doing Now

üîÑ **Organizing our learning materials** (this structure)

üîÑ **Presenting architecture thinking to Omar** for review

üîÑ **Asking questions** to understand Omar's vision

‚è≥ **Waiting for Omar's decisions** on key questions

### What's Next

**After Omar reviews architecture thinking:**

1. **Move to DESIGN phase** (Phase 0)
2. **Create detailed designs** based on Omar's decisions
3. **Get Omar's approval** on complete design
4. **Then and only then** move to implementation

**We will NOT build anything until design is approved.**

## The Three Phases

### LEARNING Phase (We Are Here)

**Purpose:** Learn TAC, explore architecture options, think deeply

**Location:** `~/work/learning/`

**Deliverables:**

- TAC analysis (done)
- Architecture thinking documents (done)
- Decision log (in progress)
- Omar's input on key questions (pending)

**Duration:** Until Omar approves moving to design

---

### DESIGN Phase (Phase 0 - Next)

**Purpose:** Design complete system architecture with Omar's validation

**Location:** `~/work/design/`

**Deliverables:**

- System architecture documentation
- Commander system prompts
- Directory structure specification
- Capability domains specification
- Implementation roadmap
- Validation criteria

**Duration:** ~20 hours + Omar's review time

---

### IMPLEMENTATION Phase (Phases 1-5 - Future)

**Purpose:** Build the agentic system progressively

**Location:** `~/work/system/`

**Deliverables:**

- Working Commander agent
- Capability domains (knowledge, business, etc.)
- Autonomous workflows
- Tested and validated systems

**Duration:** ~145 hours across 5 phases with validation gates

---

## Key Insights from Learning Phase

### 1. Claude Code CLI ‚â† Commander

**Problem:** Claude Code CLI has Anthropic's system prompt

- Makes me "accelerate to solutions"
- Like driving in 1st gear but car forces 5th gear
- Not aligned with Omar's need for thoughtful design

**Solution:** Use Claude Agent SDK

- Custom system prompt designed by Omar
- Complete control over behavior
- Phase-appropriate responses

### 2. Scripts ‚â† Systems

**What I built:** 5 Python scripts (application logic)

**What TAC requires:** Agentic infrastructure

- `.claude/commands/` (slash commands)
- `adws/` (orchestrators)
- `specs/` (specifications)
- Event-driven automation
- Persistent state
- Self-correction

**Gap:** CRITICAL across all dimensions

### 3. We're in LEARNING, Not Development

**Phases:**

- LEARNING: Where we are now (think, explore, learn)
- DESIGN: Where we go next (design, specify, plan)
- IMPLEMENTATION: Where we build (code, test, deploy)

**_Premature implementation = wasted effort_**

### 4. Progressive > Big Bang

**Progressive approach:**

- 5 phases with Omar's validation gates
- Delivers value incrementally (Week 3, Week 4, Week 6)
- Lower risk (fail fast at any gate)
- Same total effort (165 hours)

**Better than:** All upfront (165 hours, no validation, high risk)

### 5. Capability Domains, Not Agents

**Subdirectories are:**

- Persistent functional areas (domains)
- Infrastructure that enables capabilities
- Like departments in an organization

**Subdirectories are NOT:**

- Agents (those are transient executors)
- Managers or directors
- Organizational roles

### 6. The 50% Rule (TAC-8)

**_Spend 50%+ time on agentic layer, not application layer_**

**What I did wrong:**

- 100% application (the scripts)
- 0% agentic layer (no infrastructure)

**_Guaranteed failure from the start_**

## Questions for Omar (Outstanding)

### From Commander Design

1. Which thinking speed for LEARNING phase?
2. Which authority model?
3. Should system prompt change by phase?
4. Which error handling approach?
5. Which communication style?
6. Which validation approach?
7. Tool permissions and mode?

### From Directory Architecture

1. Which directory structure (Options A-F)?
2. Separate from or integrate with ~/.claude/?
3. Should ~/work/system/ be a git repo?

### From Capability Domains

1. Which domains for MVP (2-3 domains)?
2. Domain scope for each?
3. Any missing domains?

### From Implementation Plan

1. Does progressive approach make sense?
2. Is 6-week timeline realistic?
3. Are success metrics correct?
