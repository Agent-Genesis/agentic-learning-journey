## Key Questions Answered

### Question 1: What is the precise definition of "build systems that build systems"?
**Answer Location:** Comprehensive Analysis, Section 1
**Quick Answer:** Creating an agentic layer (meta-infrastructure with templates, prompts, workflows) that orchestrates AI agents to autonomously generate and maintain code.

### Question 2: What's the difference between "scripts" and "systems" in TAC?
**Answer Location:** Comprehensive Analysis, Section 2; Quick Reference (table)
**Quick Answer:** Scripts solve individual problems once. Systems solve entire problem classes repeatedly, autonomously, with continuous improvement.

### Question 3: What does "Commander of Compute" mean in practice?
**Answer Location:** Comprehensive Analysis, Section 3; Quick Reference (Five Pillars #3)
**Quick Answer:** You orchestrate agents strategically rather than writing code tactically. You operate at the strategic layer while agents handle tactical execution.

### Question 4: What are "The Core Four" and why are Tools the game-changer?
**Answer Location:** Comprehensive Analysis, Section 4; Quick Reference (Five Pillars #2)
**Quick Answer:** Context, Model, Prompt, Tools. Tools transform agents from advisors (Phase 1) to executors (Phase 2) - enabling autonomous long-running workflows.

### Question 5: How does TAC define "automation" vs "autonomy"?
**Answer Location:** Comprehensive Analysis, Section 5
**Quick Answer:** Automation = deterministic rules (scales linearly). Autonomy = agent reasoning (scales exponentially). TAC combines both.

### Question 6: What does "programmable agents" mean (with examples)?
**Answer Location:** Comprehensive Analysis, Section 6
**Quick Answer:** Embedding Claude Code in your workflows so agents can be invoked programmatically, enabling orchestration, chaining, and automation.

## Core Concepts Reference

### The Three-Layer Architecture
```
STRATEGIC LAYER (Human - You)
├─ Vision, decisions, standards

AGENTIC LAYER (AI - Agents) ← 50%+ investment here
├─ Templates, workflows, orchestration

APPLICATION LAYER (Output)
├─ Generated code, infrastructure, products
```

### The Gateway Script Concept
- Bridge between deterministic code and agentic execution
- Calls an agent (not application logic)
- Enables orchestration of multiple agents
- Starting point for "systems that build systems"

### The 12 Leverage Points
- 4 In-Agent (Context, Model, Prompt, Tools)
- 8 Through-Agent (Documentation, Types, Architecture, Tests, Planning, ADWs, KPIs, One-Shot Success)
- Single point = 2x improvement
- All 12 = 16x+ exponential improvement

### The Agentic Layer Parabola
```
Week 1: Thin → 2x value
Week 2: Growing → 10x value  
Week 3: Substantial → 100x value
Week 4+: Dense → Parabolic returns
```

## Applied to Your Governance System

### Current State (Script)
- Manual document updates
- Ad hoc governance changes
- One-time protocols
- High human overhead

### Target State (System)
- Templated governance workflows
- Autonomous protocol updates
- Reusable governance patterns
- Self-validating systems
- 50% effort on agentic infrastructure

### Implementation Path
1. Identify governance problem classes
2. Template solutions for each class
3. Build gateway scripts for orchestration
4. Add feedback loops (validation, self-correction)
5. Measure leverage multiplication
6. Evolve with parabolic returns

## The Single Guiding Question

> **"Am I investing enough time in my agentic layer?"**

Apply this to governance:
- Are you building sustainable governance infrastructure?
- Or just managing documents manually?
- Are you solving governance CLASSES of problems?
- Or individual governance issues?
