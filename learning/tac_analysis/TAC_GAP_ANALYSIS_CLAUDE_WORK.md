# TAC Gap Analysis: Claude's Scripts vs Production Systems Standards

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Scope:** Honest assessment of 5 scripts built by Claude against TAC production standards
**Authority:** Omar's review pending - this is DEMONSTRATION, not approval

---

## Executive Summary: The Brutal Truth

**Classification:** All 5 scripts are **SCRIPTS** (TAC Level 1), not **SYSTEMS** (TAC Level 3-4).

**Gap severity:** CRITICAL across all dimensions

**What's present:** Working code that demonstrates concepts
**What's missing:** Everything required for production systems

**Estimated effort to reach "systems" level:** 40-60 hours per script (200-300 hours total)
**Estimated effort to satisfy "build systems that build systems":** Additional 80-120 hours

---

## Part 1: Script-by-Script Classification

### Script 1: extract_learnings.py

**TAC Classification:** SCRIPT (One-off tool)

**Evidence it's a script:**
- Single-purpose: Extract from LEARNINGS.md only
- No feedback loops (doesn't verify extracted techniques are useful)
- No self-correction (if extraction fails, stays failed)
- Not composable (hardcoded format assumptions)
- No state management (run once, done)
- No improvement mechanism (doesn't learn from mistakes)

**Test results:** 5/5 discoveries extracted ✓

**What this proves:** Basic parsing works for happy path
**What this doesn't prove:** Robustness, edge cases, production reliability

**TAC Quality Level:** Proof of Concept (30% confidence)
- Works on one specific LEARNINGS.md format
- No error handling for format variations
- No tests for edge cases
- No validation of output quality

---

### Script 2: orchestrate_discovery.py

**TAC Classification:** SCRIPT (Keyword matcher)

**Evidence it's a script:**
- Simple keyword matching (not semantic understanding)
- No learning (pattern list is static)
- No validation (doesn't check if suggestions helped)
- No feedback loop (user can't improve matching)
- No state (stateless matcher)
- Cannot solve problem classes (each request handled identically)

**Test results:** Identified relevant techniques ✓

**What this proves:** Basic keyword matching works
**What this doesn't prove:** Effectiveness at improving discovery rate

**TAC Quality Level:** Working / In-Development (50% confidence)
- Core matching logic works
- No validation of actual discovery improvement
- No self-tuning based on success/failure
- No persistence of learned patterns

---

### Script 3: validate_discovery.py

**TAC Classification:** SCRIPT (Test harness)

**Evidence it's a script:**
- Hardcoded test scenarios (3 total)
- No dynamic test generation
- No self-correction when tests fail
- No state tracking across runs
- No improvement loop
- Cannot solve test problem class (just runs what's defined)

**Test results:** Framework present but incomplete

**What this proves:** Test structure exists
**What this doesn't prove:** Tests actually validate discovery effectiveness

**TAC Quality Level:** Proof of Concept (30% confidence)
- Test infrastructure present
- Only 3 hardcoded scenarios
- No actual Claude Code integration (would timeout)
- No baseline data collected
- No statistical significance

---

### Script 4: detect_insights.py

**TAC Classification:** SCRIPT (Pattern matcher)

**Evidence it's a script:**
- Regex pattern matching (not semantic understanding)
- No validation of "insight" quality
- No feedback loop (can't learn what's valuable)
- No integration with techniques library
- No state management
- Single-pass processing (no refinement)

**Test results:** Found 0 insights on LEARNINGS.md ✗

**What this proves:** Pattern matching is too narrow/brittle
**What this doesn't prove:** Concept is fundamentally flawed (might just need better patterns)

**TAC Quality Level:** Proof of Concept (20% confidence)
- False negatives likely (missed real insights)
- No validation mechanism
- No tuning capability
- Pattern list is static guesswork

---

### Script 5: generate_plan.py

**TAC Classification:** SCRIPT (Template filler)

**Evidence it's a script:**
- Simple template substitution
- No plan quality validation
- No learning from plan success/failure
- No adaptation to project context
- No refinement loop
- Generic output (not domain-specific)

**Test results:** Generated generic plan

**What this proves:** Template rendering works
**What this doesn't prove:** Plans are useful, complete, or accurate

**TAC Quality Level:** Proof of Concept (40% confidence)
- Basic template logic works
- Output is generic/shallow
- No domain knowledge
- No validation of plan quality
- No feedback from execution outcomes

---

## Part 2: Infrastructure Gap Analysis

## Part 3: Capabilities Gap Analysis

### What's Missing to be "Systems"

Using TAC scripts vs systems rubric from TAC_BUILD_SYSTEMS_COMPREHENSIVE_ANALYSIS.md:

| Criterion | Required for System | Current State | Gap |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------|-----|
| **Reusability** | Solves problem classes | Each script solves 1 specific problem | CRITICAL |
| **Version Control** | Prompts in .claude/commands/ | Scripts in .claude/scripts/, no prompt templates | MAJOR |
| **Improvement** | Gets better each run | Static logic, no learning | CRITICAL |
| **Composition** | Part of orchestration | 5 isolated scripts | CRITICAL |
| **Problem Scope** | Entire problem class | Individual instances | CRITICAL |
| **Execution Model** | Autonomous + event-driven | Manual invocation only | CRITICAL |
| **Feedback Loops** | Self-validating | No validation | CRITICAL |

**Diagnosis:** 0/7 system criteria met. These are definitively SCRIPTS.

---

## Part 6: What "Satisfies Tactic #1" Would Require

### TAC Tactic #1: Stop Coding - Build Systems That Build Systems

**Current State:** We built 5 scripts. This is CODING, not building systems.

**What Tactic #1 Actually Requires:**

From TAC_BUILD_SYSTEMS_COMPREHENSIVE_ANALYSIS.md:

> "Build systems that build systems means creating meta-level infrastructure (the agentic layer) that orchestrates AI agents to autonomously generate, test, and deploy code"

**The Three-Component Minimum Viable Agentic Layer:**

1. **Prompts** (.claude/commands/) - Version-controlled templates
   - **Required:** Reusable templates for problem classes
   - **Missing:** No .claude/commands/ templates
   - **Effort:** 15-20 hours to create template system

2. **Plans** (.specs/) - Agent-generated specifications
   - **Required:** Automated plan generation integrated with execution
   - **Missing:** generate_plan.py exists but not integrated
   - **Effort:** 10-15 hours to integrate with workflow

3. **Workflows** (ADWs) - Agent orchestration scripts
   - **Required:** Scripts that call Claude Code to solve problem classes
   - **Missing:** Scripts don't invoke agents
   - **Effort:** 40-60 hours to build ADW framework

---

### The Gateway Script Pattern (Missing)

**TAC Requirement:** Scripts should be "gateway scripts" that invoke agents, not application logic.

**Current State:** All 5 scripts contain application logic (parsing, matching, generating).

**Required Transformation:**

**BEFORE (current - script):**
```python
def extract_learnings(file):
    # 200 lines of parsing logic
    discoveries = parse_novel_discoveries(content)
    techniques = generate_techniques(discoveries)
    return techniques
```

**AFTER (system - gateway script):**
```python
def extract_learnings_gateway(file):
    # Invoke agent to extract learnings
    result = invoke_claude_code(
        template=".claude/commands/extract-learnings.md",
        context={"learnings_file": file}
    )
    # Validate and store
    validate_extraction(result)
    return result
```

**Difference:** 
- Script = WE wrote the solution
- Gateway = AGENT reasons about solution, we orchestrate

**Effort to transform all 5 scripts:** 30-40 hours

---

### The Feedback Loop Requirement (Missing)

**TAC Tactic #5:** "Always Add Feedback Loops"

**Required for each script:**
1. Self-validation (script checks its own output quality)
2. Success/failure tracking
3. Automatic improvement from failures
4. Re-execution with corrections

**Current State:** Zero feedback loops implemented

**Example Required Feedback Loop for extract_learnings.py:**

```
Extract → Validate Quality → If Poor → Adjust Extraction → Re-extract → Store Metrics
```

**Effort to add feedback loops to all 5:** 40-50 hours

---

### The Composition Requirement (Missing)

**TAC Requirement:** Systems compose into larger orchestrations

**Required Orchestration Example:**
```
New Session → 
  detect_insights.py (find insights) → 
  extract_learnings.py (extract discoveries) →
  orchestrate_discovery.py (update patterns) →
  validate_discovery.py (test improvement) →
  generate_plan.py (plan next improvements)
```

**Current State:** 5 isolated scripts, no composition

**Effort to build orchestration layer:** 30-40 hours

---

### Total Effort to Satisfy Tactic #1

**Component Build:**
- Template system (.claude/commands/): 15-20 hours
- Plan integration (.specs/): 10-15 hours
- ADW framework: 40-60 hours
- Gateway transformation: 30-40 hours
- Feedback loops: 40-50 hours
- Orchestration layer: 30-40 hours

**Total:** 165-225 hours

**Plus Production-Ready requirements:** 100 hours

**Grand Total:** 265-325 hours

---

## Part 7: The Honest Assessment

### What We Actually Built

**In TAC terms:**
- 5 proof-of-concept scripts
- Demonstrates basic concepts work
- Shows potential for automation
- NOT production systems
- NOT "build systems that build systems"
- NOT satisfying Tactic #1

**Appropriate classification:** TAC Level 1 (Manual coding)
- We wrote code to solve specific problems
- Code is deterministic application logic
- No agent orchestration
- No problem-class solving
- No self-improvement

**What TAC Level 4 looks like:**
- Agents orchestrate other agents
- Solves problem classes, not problems
- Self-correcting with feedback loops
- Autonomous execution
- Gets better over time

**Gap:** We're at Level 1, targeting Level 4. That's a 3-level gap.

---

### The 50%+ Rule Violation

**TAC Tactic #8:** "More than half of your engineering time should be spent on the agentic layer rather than the application layer."

**What we did:**
- 100% time writing application logic (parsing, matching, generating)
- 0% time building agentic orchestration
- 0% time on templates/prompts
- 0% time on feedback loops

**This is backwards.** We should have spent:
- 50%+ building the orchestration framework
- 50%- on the actual logic (or let agents write it)

---

### Why These Are Scripts, Not Systems

**The litmus test from TAC:**

> "A solution is a SYSTEM if it meets these criteria: Reusable across multiple problems, Version controlled prompts, Improves over time, Composes into orchestration, Solves problem CLASSES, Autonomous execution, Self-validating"

**Our scripts:**
- ✗ Not reusable (each solves one problem)
- ✗ No version-controlled prompts
- ✗ Don't improve over time
- ✗ Don't compose
- ✗ Solve individual problems, not classes
- ✗ Require manual invocation
- ✗ No self-validation

**Score:** 0/7 system criteria

**Classification:** SCRIPTS (definitively)

---

## Part 8: What "Build Systems That Build Systems" Actually Means

### The Misunderstanding

**What we thought:** "Write scripts that automate tasks"
**What TAC means:** "Build orchestration layer that commands agents to solve problem classes"

**Example of the difference:**

**SCRIPT (what we built):**
```python
# We wrote logic to extract learnings
def extract_learnings(file):
    discoveries = parse_file(file)  # We figured out parsing
    techniques = format_techniques(discoveries)  # We formatted output
    return techniques
```

**SYSTEM (what TAC requires):**
```python
# Agent orchestration that solves the class of "extraction problems"
class ExtractionADW:
    def solve_extraction_class(self, source_type, target_format):
        # Agent reasons about extraction, we just orchestrate
        plan = self.planning_agent(source_type, target_format)
        extracted = self.extraction_agent(plan)
        validated = self.validation_agent(extracted)
        if not validated.success:
            extracted = self.correction_agent(validated.issues)
        return extracted
```

**Key Difference:**
- Script: WE solve the problem (manual coding)
- System: AGENTS solve the problem (orchestration)

---

### The Hierarchy We're Missing

**TAC's 4-level progression:**

```
Level 1: Manual coding ← WE ARE HERE
Level 2: AI-assisted coding (human writes with AI help)
Level 3: AI-generated systems (agent writes code, human oversees)
Level 4: Systems that build systems (agents orchestrate agents) ← TAC TARGET
```

**To reach Level 4 from Level 1:** 
Not an incremental improvement. A paradigm shift.

---

### The Commander of Compute Identity

**TAC Philosophy:** Transform from coder to "Commander of Compute"

**What we did:** We CODED all 5 scripts ourselves
**What we should have done:** ORCHESTRATE agents to build systems

**The identity shift:**
- Coder: "I'll write regex to parse this file"
- Commander: "I'll orchestrate an agent to extract insights from any structured document class"

**We haven't made this shift yet.**

---

## Part 9: Remediation Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next Session)

**1. Stop calling these "systems"**
- They're scripts. Call them scripts.
- Update any documentation that claims otherwise.

**2. Choose ONE script to transform**
- Don't try to fix all 5
- Pick extract_learnings.py (most valuable)
- Transform it into a true ADW

**3. Build the missing infrastructure FIRST**
- Start with feedback loops
- Add validation
- Then add agent orchestration

### Medium-term Roadmap (2-4 weeks)

**Week 1: Transform extract_learnings.py to ADW**
- Add feedback loop (validate extractions)
- Add agent invocation capability
- Create .claude/commands/extract-learnings.md template
- Build self-correction loop
- Achieve 90%+ test coverage

**Week 2: Build orchestration layer**
- Create ADW framework
- Enable script composition
- Add state management
- Add workflow orchestration

**Week 3: Production hardening**
- Add full test suite
- Add monitoring/logging
- Add error recovery
- Add documentation

**Week 4: Validate and measure**
- Measure improvement over baseline
- Collect success/failure metrics
- Refine based on data
- Achieve 90%+ confidence

### Long-term (2-3 months)

**Goal:** True "build systems that build systems"

**Deliverable:** Agentic layer that:
- Solves extraction problem class (not just LEARNINGS.md)
- Solves discovery problem class (not just keyword matching)
- Solves validation problem class (not just hardcoded tests)
- Composes into meta-workflows
- Improves itself based on feedback
- Operates autonomously

**This is 200-300 hours of work.**

---

## Part 11: The Bottom Line

### What We Demonstrated

✓ Basic concepts work
✓ Parsing is possible
✓ Pattern matching is possible
✓ Template rendering is possible
✓ We can write Python

### What We Didn't Demonstrate

✗ Production-readiness
✗ Systems-level thinking
✗ Agent orchestration
✗ Problem-class solving
✗ Self-improvement
✗ Feedback loops
✗ Composition
✗ Autonomous operation

### What This Means

**These scripts are valuable as:**
- Proof of concept demonstrations
- Learning exercises
- Prototypes to inform real implementation

**These scripts are NOT:**
- Production systems
- TAC "systems that build systems"
- Ready for autonomous operation
- Satisfying Tactic #1 requirements

### The Honest Path Forward

**Option 1: Keep as POCs**
- Document as "experimental prototypes"
- Use for manual exploration only
- Don't invest more time

**Option 2: Transform ONE to production**
- Pick extract_learnings.py
- Invest 100+ hours to make it production-ready
- Use as template for others

**Option 3: Start over with TAC approach**
- Build agentic layer FIRST
- Let agents write the logic
- Focus on orchestration, not coding
- Follow TAC playbook properly

**Recommendation:** Option 3 (start over, do it right)

**Why:** We're 200-300 hours from satisfying Tactic #1 with current approach. Starting fresh with proper TAC architecture might be faster and better.

## Appendix C: Key Quotes from TAC

> "Avoid ad hoc prompts that can't be improved. Build reusable, version-controlled prompts and templates that get better with each execution."

**Our violation:** We built 5 ad hoc scripts with no templates.

> "Focus on building ADWs that solve classes of problems rather than individual issues."

**Our violation:** Each script solves exactly one problem, not a class.

> "The gateway script is your entry point into agentic coding. It's distinctly different from any other type of code - it's calling an agent."

**Our violation:** Our scripts contain logic, not agent calls.

> "More than half of your engineering time should be spent on the agentic layer rather than the application layer."

**Our violation:** 100% time on application layer, 0% on agentic layer.

## Final Verdict

**Classification:** 5 proof-of-concept SCRIPTS
**TAC Level:** 1 (Manual coding)
**Production Readiness:** 0% (POC stage)
**Tactic #1 Satisfaction:** 0% (not started)
**Confidence:** 34% average (DO NOT SHIP)

**Gap Severity:** CRITICAL across all dimensions

**Estimated effort to close all gaps:** 265-325 hours

**Status for Omar's review:** DEMONSTRATION of concepts, NOT production systems, NOT approval-ready, NOT satisfying TAC Tactic #1

**Recommendation:** Start fresh with proper TAC architecture (agentic layer first, agent orchestration, ADW framework) rather than trying to retrofit these scripts.
