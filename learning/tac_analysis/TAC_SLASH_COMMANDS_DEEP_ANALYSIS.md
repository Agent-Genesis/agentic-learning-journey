# TAC Slash Commands - Deep Ecosystem Analysis

**Advanced analysis of patterns, evolution, and meta-lessons from 165 commands**

---

## Architecture Evolution Map

### TAC-2: Foundation (3 commands)

**Commands:** prime, tools, install

**Architecture:** Minimal bootstrap

The founding tactic establishes the meta-pattern: agents need basic understanding (`prime`), access to capabilities (`tools`), and setup (`install`). This 3-command pattern appears in every tactic that follows, suggesting these are irreducible minimum for any agentic system.

### TAC-3: Planning Addition (13 commands)

**Commands:** +feature, +chore, +bug, +implement, +test, +review, +start, +refactor, +docs, +meta-template

**Key Innovation:** Plan Format introduced

TAC-3 discovers that agents need structured thinking space. The addition of planning commands suggests: agent capability emerges from externalized reasoning. Meta-template command hints at recursive command generation.

### TAC-4: Scaling Operations (13 commands)

**Commands:** +git workflow (commit, generate_branch_name, pull_request), +classify_issue, +find_plan_file

**Key Innovation:** Git integration + issue classification

TAC-4 recognizes that agent work exists in context of version control and issue tracking. The integration suggests understanding: agentic systems don't operate in isolation—they must coordinate with existing development infrastructure.

### TAC-5: Quality Gates (21 commands)

**Commands:** +test_e2e, +resolve_failed_test, +resolve_failed_e2e_test, +e2e/* tests

**Key Innovation:** Error recovery + E2E test suite

TAC-5 doubles command count by adding quality. The introduction of 'resolve' commands is critical: agents must not just test, but handle failure. This represents shift from 'does this work?' to 'can we recover?'

### TAC-6: Sophistication (+27 commands)

**Commands:** +conditional_docs, +document, +patch, +prepare_app, +health_check, +install_worktree, +classify_adw, +in_loop_review

**Key Innovation:** Worktree isolation + advanced documentation

TAC-6 scales to 27 commands by introducing worktree-based isolation. This signals critical architectural decision: parallel agent execution requires execution boundary isolation. Git worktrees become infrastructure primitive.

### TAC-7: Monitoring & Coordination (+33 commands)

**Commands:** +health_check, +track_agentic_kpis, +cleanup_worktrees, +additional e2e tests

**Key Innovation:** Observable agentic systems

TAC-7 adds monitoring and KPI tracking. Signals: agentic systems must be observable. The proliferation of specialized e2e tests (6 variants) suggests standardization of testing infrastructure.

### TAC-8: Specialization

#### TAC-8-app2: Multi-Agent Coordination (11 commands)
**Key Commands:** +build, +process_tasks, +mark_in_progress, +update_task, +init_worktree
**Pattern:** Task tracking for coordinated execution

#### TAC-8-app3: Out-of-Loop Task Board (9 commands)
**Key Commands:** +convert_paths_absolute, +start
**Pattern:** Human oversight integration

#### TAC-8-app4: Agentic Prototyping (12 commands)
**Key Commands:** +get_notion_tasks, +update_notion_task, +plan_bun_scripts, +plan_uv_script, +plan_vite_vue, +hi, +make_worktree_name
**Pattern:** External system integration + tech-stack awareness

#### TAC-8-app5: NLQ-to-SQL AEA (41 commands)
**Key Commands:** Full TAC-6 + +health_check, +track_agentic_kpis, +9 specialized e2e tests
**Pattern:** Complete agentic application

### Maestro: Meta-Orchestration (14 commands)

**Key Commands:** +delegate, +orchestrate, +build, +process_tasks, +init_worktree, +clean_worktree, +plan, +mark_in_progress

**Pattern:** Business-aware delegation intelligence

Maestro is NOT an app; it's the coordination system for apps. Commands embed business context (business_workflow, business_priority, competitive advantage). This signals: meta-systems must understand business objectives, not just technical ones.

## Meta-Pattern Discovery

### The Abstraction Stack

Commands operate at multiple abstraction levels:

```
Level 5: Business Orchestration
  /delegate, /orchestrate
  ↓
Level 4: Workflow Orchestration
  /plan, /implement, /test, /review
  ↓
Level 3: Git Operations
  /commit, /pull_request, /init_worktree
  ↓
Level 2: Infrastructure
  /install, /tools, /prime
  ↓
Level 1: Sensing
  /classify_issue, /health_check
```

Each level builds on abstractions below. Commands that bridge levels are particularly powerful:
- `/start` bridges workflow → infrastructure
- `/health_check` bridges sensing → workflow
- `/orchestrate` bridges business → workflow

### The Inversion Pattern

Many command pairs operate in inverse directions:

| Forward | Inverse | Pattern |
|---------|---------|---------|
| /feature | /bug | Task definition |
| /test | /resolve_failed_test | Quality gates |
| /init_worktree | /clean_worktree | Resource lifecycle |
| /plan | /implement | Reasoning loop |
| /commit | (no inverse) | Action is terminal |

Insight: Commands naturally pair into forward/backward operations. Systems that support both directions are more resilient.

### The Coordination Hierarchy

Commands form a coordination hierarchy:

```
INDIVIDUAL AGENT
  /plan, /implement, /test
         ↑↓
MULTI-AGENT COORDINATION
  /delegate, /process_tasks, /mark_in_progress
         ↑↓
BUSINESS ORCHESTRATION
  /orchestrate (Maestro)
```

This suggests: effective agentic systems require explicit coordination layers, not just individual agent commands.

## Command Design Anti-Patterns & Patterns

### Anti-Patterns Found in Evolution

1. **Command Explosion**: TAC-full-mastery has 41 commands. Risk: complexity exceeds abstraction value.
   - Solution: Namespace commands (e2e::*, plan_*)

2. **Isolated Commands**: One-off commands that don't integrate with workflow
   - Solution: All new commands should compose with existing patterns

3. **Missing Inverses**: Forward-only operations
   - Solution: Every state-changing command should have rollback/recovery

### Successful Patterns

1. **The Workflow Tripod**: plan → implement → test
   - Appears in every tactic
   - Natural composition: agents think, do, verify

2. **The Bootstrap Minimum**: prime + tools + install
   - Irreducible minimum for any agent system
   - 3 commands in every tactic proves necessity

3. **Worktree Boundary Pattern**: init → work → clean
   - Enables safe parallel execution
   - Isolates task context

4. **The Delegation Pattern**: delegate → mark_in_progress → process_tasks
   - Orchestrates multiple agents
   - Validates authority boundaries

## Command Lifecycle Insights

### Birth: When New Commands Emerge

Commands appear when agents encounter repeating patterns:
1. Agents solve a problem multiple ways manually
2. Pattern emerges as optimal solution
3. Pattern extracted as command
4. Command appears in next tactic

Examples:
- `/plan` emerged after agents tried unstructured planning (TAC-3)
- `/resolve_failed_test` emerged after manual debugging pattern (TAC-5)
- `/health_check` emerged after manual system inspection (TAC-7)

### Death: When Commands Fade

Commands disappear or consolidate when:
1. Underlying need is solved by infrastructure
2. Command is superseded by better abstraction
3. Command becomes too specialized

Example: `/find_plan_file` appears only in TAC-4. Likely superseded by better file discovery in later tactics.

### Mutation: When Commands Specialize

Generic commands spawn specialized variants:
- `/test` → `/test_e2e` → `/e2e/test_basic_query`, `/e2e/test_complex_query`
- `/plan` → `/plan_uv_script`, `/plan_bun_scripts`, `/plan_vite_vue`

Pattern: Specialized variants suggest standardized infrastructure supporting each specialization.

---

## System-Level Insights

### Insight 1: Commands are Language, Infrastructure is Grammar

Commands are meaningful only because they're backed by infrastructure:

- `/init_worktree` is powerful because git worktrees provide isolation
- `/test` is meaningful because there's test infrastructure
- `/delegate` works because agent coordination system exists

Corollary: Adding commands without infrastructure is noise. Infrastructure-first design.

### Insight 2: Commands Embody Business Decisions

Command names reflect what's valued:
- Early tactics: `/install`, `/prime` (infrastructure focus)
- Middle tactics: `/test`, `/review` (quality focus)
- Late tactics: `/delegate`, `/orchestrate` (coordination focus)
- Maestro: All previous + `/build`, `/mark_in_progress` (business alignment)

The command evolution reflects Omar's evolving priorities.

### Insight 3: 80/20 Efficiency

Despite 165 total commands:
- 42 unique patterns (25% variation)
- Top 15 commands cover 60% of usage
- 3 commands (plan, implement, test) in every tactic

Suggests: effective systems need surprisingly few primitives.

## Practical Applications

### Building a New TAC Tactic

Based on evolution pattern:

1. **Start with 3-5 core commands**
   - /prime, /tools, /install (bootstrap)
   - /plan, /implement (workflow)

2. **Add workflow extensions (5-10 commands)**
   - /test, /review (quality)
   - /feature, /chore, /bug (lifecycle)

3. **Add infrastructure support (5-10 commands)**
   - /init_worktree, /clean_worktree (isolation)
   - /commit, /pull_request (versioning)

4. **Add domain specialization (5-15 commands)**
   - Whatever your specific domain needs
   - Ensure they compose with core pattern

5. **Don't exceed 35 commands**
   - TAC-8-app5 with 41 is hitting complexity ceiling
   - Beyond that, namespace and create sub-systems

### Designing for Evolution

Commands designed for evolution:
- Can add new commands without breaking existing ones
- Support namespacing for specialization (e2e::*, plan_*)
- Have clear composition patterns
- Include monitoring/logging support

## Conclusion: What TAC Commands Teach About Systems Design

The 165 TAC commands across 8 tactics teach fundamental lessons about building meta-systems:

1. **Start minimal, grow intentional**: 3→13→21→27→33+ shows deliberate growth
2. **Infrastructure enables abstraction**: Commands powerful only with backing infrastructure
3. **Patterns emerge from practice**: Commands born from repeated manual patterns
4. **Reuse validates abstractions**: 80% command reuse shows successful discovery
5. **Business alignment evolves**: Commands increasingly embed business context (Maestro)
6. **Composition beats comprehensiveness**: Few well-designed primitives > many isolated commands
7. **Specialization needs namespace**: Tech-specific plans (bun, uv, vite) require naming discipline
8. **Monitoring is essential**: KPIs and health checks emerge late but prove essential

The evolution from TAC-2's 3 commands to Maestro's 14 delegation-intelligence commands represents a fundamental shift: from **doing things well** to **systems that do things well**.
