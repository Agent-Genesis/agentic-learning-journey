## Evolution Patterns

### The Growth Trajectory
```
TAC-2    → TAC-3    → TAC-4    → TAC-5    → TAC-6    → TAC-7    → TAC-8    → Maestro
3 cmds   → 13 cmds  → 13 cmds  → 21 cmds  → 27 cmds  → 33 cmds  → 41 cmds  → 14 cmds
Bootstrap  Planning   Scaling    Quality   Infra     Monitoring Specialization Meta-Orch
```

### Command Reuse Statistics

- **Ubiquitous** (5+ tactics): 10 commands (24%)
  - Examples: `/prime`, `/install`, `/tools`, `/implement`
  
- **Common** (3-4 tactics): 11 commands (26%)
  - Examples: `/test`, `/review`, `/feature`, `/bug`
  
- **Moderate** (2 tactics): 12 commands (29%)
  - Examples: `/health_check`, `/in_loop_review`, `/delegate`
  
- **Tactical** (1 tactic): 9 commands (21%)
  - Specialized to specific project needs

## Key Insights

### 1. Irreducible Minimum
The 3-command bootstrap pattern (`/prime`, `/tools`, `/install`) appears in every tactic, suggesting these are non-negotiable for any agentic system.

### 2. Abstraction Efficiency
42 unique patterns across 165 commands (25% variation) indicates highly efficient abstraction design.

### 3. Infrastructure-First
Commands are powerful only because they're backed by supporting infrastructure (git worktrees, plan format, etc.). Infrastructure enables abstraction.

### 4. Business Evolution
Command names reflect evolving priorities:
- Early: Infrastructure focus (`/install`, `/prime`)
- Middle: Quality focus (`/test`, `/review`)
- Late: Coordination focus (`/delegate`, `/orchestrate`)
- Maestro: Business alignment (`/mark_in_progress`, business context)

### 5. Composition Over Comprehensiveness
Successful patterns combine few primitives well rather than accumulating isolated commands.
