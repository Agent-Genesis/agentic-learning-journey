PATTERN DISCOVERIES
===================

1. IRREDUCIBLE MINIMUM
   - 3-command bootstrap pattern: /prime, /tools, /install
   - Appears in every tactic
   - Non-negotiable for any agentic system

2. ABSTRACTION EFFICIENCY
   - 42 unique patterns across 165 commands (25% variation)
   - Top 15 commands cover 60% of usage
   - Shows highly efficient abstraction design

3. COMMAND REUSE
   - Ubiquitous (5+ tactics): 10 commands (24%)
   - Common (3-4 tactics): 11 commands (26%)
   - Moderate (2 tactics): 12 commands (29%)
   - Tactical (1 tactic): 9 commands (21%)
   - 80% reuse rate validates pattern discovery

4. INFRASTRUCTURE ENABLEMENT
   - Commands powerful only with backing infrastructure
   - Git worktrees enable isolation
   - Plan format enables structured reasoning
   - Variable injection enables context preservation

5. BUSINESS EVOLUTION
   - Command names reflect evolving priorities
   - Early tactics: Infrastructure focus
   - Middle tactics: Quality focus
   - Late tactics: Coordination focus
   - Maestro: Business alignment focus

6. COMPOSITION PATTERNS
   - Linear workflow: /plan → /implement → /test
   - Quality gates: /test → /resolve_failed_test
   - Isolation: /init_worktree → work → /clean_worktree
   - Orchestration: /orchestrate → /delegate → /mark_in_progress

7. SPECIALIZATION WITHOUT LOSS
   - Commands like /plan spawn specialized variants
   - /plan_uv_script, /plan_bun_scripts, /plan_vite_vue
   - Core patterns maintained while adapting to domains

KEY INSIGHTS
============

1. Commands are language; infrastructure is grammar
   - Commands meaningless without supporting infrastructure
   - Infrastructure-first design is critical

2. 3→13→21→27→33→41 command progression is intentional
   - Not random growth
   - Each phase represents discovered necessity
   - TAC-8 at 41 commands hits complexity ceiling

3. Maestro represents quantum shift
   - Not just more commands
   - Adds delegation intelligence framework
   - Embeds business context
   - Meta-system coordinating other systems

4. 80/20 Efficiency principle
   - Few well-designed primitives > many isolated commands
   - Most value from top 3 commands
   - Specialization fills remaining 20%

5. Systems That Build Systems
   - Commands aren't just automation
   - They're abstractions enabling agent reasoning
   - Enable agents to think at higher levels
   - Pattern: abstraction enables abstraction

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
======================

FOR BUILDING A NEW TAC TACTIC:
1. Start with 3-5 core commands
   - Bootstrap: /prime, /tools, /install
   - Workflow: /plan, /implement

2. Add workflow extensions (5-10)
   - Quality: /test, /review
   - Lifecycle: /feature, /chore, /bug

3. Add infrastructure support (5-10)
   - Isolation: /init_worktree, /clean_worktree
   - Versioning: /commit, /pull_request

4. Add domain specialization (5-15)
   - Tech-specific commands
   - Integration commands
   - Ensure composition with core pattern

5. Keep under 35-40 commands
   - Beyond that hits complexity ceiling
   - Namespace for specialization
   - Create sub-systems if needed

COMMAND DESIGN PRINCIPLES
==========================

1. Single Responsibility
   - Each command does one thing well
   - Clear, focused purpose

2. Composability
   - Commands chain together naturally
   - Enable fluent command sequences
   - Support linear and branched flows

3. Idempotence
   - Commands safe to retry
   - No unexpected side effects
   - Consistent results

4. Context Preservation
   - Commands maintain state through variables
   - Enable workflow continuity
   - Support agent coordination

5. Clear Success Criteria
   - Commands communicate results explicitly
   - Enable downstream decisions
   - Support error recovery
