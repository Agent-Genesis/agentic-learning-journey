# TAC Production-Ready Standards: Quality Levels & Validation Requirements

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-10-17  
**Context:** TAC (Tactical Agentic Coding) Framework  
**Scope:** Production-readiness, completeness, and validation standards

---

## Executive Summary

In TAC, "production-ready" is not simply "code that runs." It's a carefully defined quality level that combines functional correctness, comprehensive testing, safety validation, and autonomous self-correction capabilities. This document defines the quality spectrum from proof-of-concept through enterprise-grade zero-touch engineering.

---

## Quality Levels: Complete Spectrum

### Level 1: Proof of Concept (POC)

**Definition:** Minimal working demonstration of concept feasibility.

**Characteristics:**
- Basic functionality implemented
- Limited testing (manual or single test case)
- No error handling or edge cases
- No documentation beyond comments
- May have breaking changes or incomplete features
- Not suitable for any external use

**Confidence Level:** < 30%

**Use Case:** Initial exploration, feasibility validation, spike work

**Example:** "I got the API endpoint responding with data"

---

### Level 2: Working / In-Development

**Definition:** Functional code that solves the core problem but lacks production hardening.

**Characteristics:**
- Core functionality implemented and tested manually
- Basic unit tests present (50-70% coverage)
- Some error handling
- Minimal documentation
- Known limitations documented
- May have minor bugs or edge cases

**Confidence Level:** 30-60%

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit test coverage: 50%+
- No syntax errors
- Type checking passes (TypeScript/Python)
- Runs without crashes on happy path
- One or two major error cases handled

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Code compiles/syntax passes
- [ ] Unit tests execute and pass
- [ ] Basic manual testing successful
- [ ] Major features working

**Use Case:** Feature branches, internal development, staging testing

**Example:** "The feature works for the main use case but we haven't tested all edge cases"

---

### Level 3: Production-Ready

- Comprehensive test suite with automated discovery
- Health checks that run continuously
- Monitoring and alerting integrated
- Automatic failure detection

#### 2. Self-Correction Loops
- Test failures automatically trigger resolution agents
- Fix templates for common failure patterns
- Progressive resolution strategy (simple → complex)
- Automatic re-validation after fixes
- Comprehensive logging of all corrections

#### 3. Autonomous Deployment
- Automatic PR creation and merging
- Staged rollout capability
- Automatic rollback triggers for critical failures
- Zero-human-touch shipping
- State persistence for workflow continuation

#### 4. Advanced Quality Gates
- Confidence scoring system
- Automatic deployment only when confidence > 95%
- Human escalation for edge cases
- Multi-stage validation pipeline

#### 5. Observable Metrics
- Agentic KPIs tracked (success rate, plan quality, execution time)
- Code quality metrics over time
- Feature complexity analysis
- Failure pattern recognition

#### 6. Safety Mechanisms
- Isolated execution environments (git worktrees)
- Deterministic port allocation
- Resource limits and monitoring
- Graceful failure handling
- Comprehensive audit trails

**Confidence Level:** 95%+

**Use Case:** Enterprise systems, continuous deployment pipelines, 24/7 autonomous operations

**Example:** "GitHub issue → Automatic plan → Implementation → Testing → Fix any failures → Documentation → Auto-merge to production (all without human touch)"

## The TAC "Zero-Touch" Confidence Model

### Confidence Thresholds

```
Confidence Level    Status                  Action
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
< 50%              POC / Incomplete        Do not ship
50-70%             In Development          Requires review
70-90%             Production Ready        Can ship with review
90-95%             Enterprise Grade        Can ship with automation
95%+               Zero-Touch Ready        Auto-ship autonomously
```

### What TAC Teaches About "Complete"

#### From TAC-4 (AFK Agents):
A tactic is "complete" when:
1. The implementation plan is detailed and accurate
2. Code implements the full specification
3. All validation commands pass
4. PR is created with proper context
5. Code review process completes
6. Ready for merge

#### From TAC-5 (Feedback Loops):
A tactic is "validated" when:
1. All unit tests pass (90%+ coverage)
2. All integration tests pass
3. All E2E tests pass (if UI involved)
4. All security tests pass
5. All regressions prevented
6. Confidence >= 90%

#### From TAC-7 (Zero-Touch Engineering):
A tactic is "production-grade" when:
1. Confidence >= 90% (from validation)
2. Zero regressions proven
3. Can run without human oversight
4. All tests pass automatically
5. Self-correction loops functional
6. Comprehensive logging in place

### Production Confidence Scoring

**The TAC Production Confidence Formula:**

```
Confidence = (Validation Coverage × 0.4) + 
             (Test Pass Rate × 0.3) + 
             (Review Score × 0.2) +
             (Security Score × 0.1)

Where:
  Validation Coverage = % of validation layers passing
  Test Pass Rate = % of tests passing
  Review Score = No blocking issues (1.0) or has blockers (0.0)
  Security Score = Security tests passing (1.0) or failing (0.0)
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Validation Coverage: 95% = 0.95
- Test Pass Rate: 98% = 0.98
- Review Score: No blockers = 1.0
- Security Score: All pass = 1.0

Confidence = (0.95 × 0.4) + (0.98 × 0.3) + (1.0 × 0.2) + (1.0 × 0.1)
           = 0.38 + 0.294 + 0.2 + 0.1
           = **97.4% (Enterprise-Grade)**

## TAC Testing Standards

### The Seven Validation Layers

TAC defines production-readiness through seven distinct validation layers, from fastest (syntax) to slowest (E2E):

#### Layer 1: Syntax & Compilation (Fast: < 10 seconds)
**What:** Code compiles and has valid syntax
```bash
# Python
cd app/server && uv run python -m py_compile server.py main.py core/*.py

# TypeScript
cd app/client && bun tsc --noEmit
```
**Pass Criteria:** Zero compilation errors  
**Failure Impact:** Code won't run at all  
**Auto-Fixable:** Sometimes (syntax errors often obvious)

#### Layer 2: Linting & Code Quality (Fast: 10-30 seconds)
**What:** Code follows standards, no obvious bugs
```bash
# Python
cd app/server && uv run ruff check .

# JavaScript/TypeScript
cd app/client && bun run lint
```
**Pass Criteria:** Zero critical violations  
**Failure Impact:** Potential bugs, style violations  
**Auto-Fixable:** Usually (many linters can auto-fix)

#### Layer 3: Unit Testing (Medium: 1-5 minutes)
**What:** Individual components work correctly
```bash
# Backend
cd app/server && uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short

# Frontend build
cd app/client && bun run build
```
**Pass Criteria:** 90%+ tests passing, 90%+ coverage  
**Failure Impact:** Component-level bugs  
**Auto-Fixable:** Sometimes (logic errors need investigation)

#### Layer 4: Integration Testing (Medium: 5-10 minutes)
**What:** Components work together correctly
**Pass Criteria:** API endpoints respond correctly, database operations work  
**Failure Impact:** System-level bugs  
**Auto-Fixable:** Rarely (usually requires architectural understanding)

#### Layer 5: End-to-End Testing (Slow: 10-30 minutes)
**What:** Complete user workflows work
```bash
# Browser automation with Playwright
cd app/client && playwright test
```
**Pass Criteria:** All user journeys complete successfully  
**Failure Impact:** User-facing failures  
**Auto-Fixable:** Sometimes (UI interactions can be fixed)

#### Layer 6: Security Testing (Medium: 5-15 minutes)
**What:** No security vulnerabilities
```bash
# SQL injection tests
cd app/server && uv run pytest tests/test_sql_injection.py -v
```
**Pass Criteria:** All security tests passing  
**Failure Impact:** Critical vulnerabilities  
**Auto-Fixable:** Rarely (requires security expertise)

#### Layer 7: Review & Acceptance (Human: 10-30 minutes)
**What:** Code meets specification and acceptance criteria
**Pass Criteria:** No blocking issues, matches spec, screenshots validate functionality  
**Failure Impact:** Requirement mismatches  
**Auto-Fixable:** No (requires human judgment)

### Standard Test Execution Order

TAC defines a specific order for running tests, from fastest/least dependent to slowest/most dependent:

```
1. Python Syntax Check         (~5 sec)
2. Backend Code Quality        (~15 sec)
3. TypeScript Check            (~10 sec)
4. Frontend Build              (~30 sec)
5. Backend Unit Tests          (~2 min)
6. Frontend E2E Tests          (~10-20 min)
7. Security Tests              (~5 min)
8. Manual Review               (~15 min)
```

**Why This Order?**
- Fast failures first (syntax, types)
- Build validation before feature tests
- Unit tests before integration tests
- Security tests independent of speed
- Human review last (doesn't block automation)

---

## TAC-7 Zero-Touch Engineering Standards

## TAC Quality Philosophy

### The Core Principle

In TAC, "production-ready" is not just about code quality—it's about **confidence and automation**:

1. **Confidence** - You know it will work (90%+ confidence)
2. **Validation** - Every layer has been tested
3. **Safety** - Regressions prevented and corrected
4. **Automation** - Deployable without human code review
5. **Observability** - Every action logged and audited

### The TAC Progression

```
Lesson 1: Stop Coding
  → Use agents instead of manual coding

Lesson 2: Apply Leverage Points  
  → Build systems systematically

Lesson 3: Template Your Engineering
  → Encode workflows as reusable patterns

Lesson 4: Stay Out The Loop
  → Build AFK agents for autonomous execution

Lesson 5: Always Add Feedback Loops
  → Create self-correcting systems

Lesson 6-8: Advanced Orchestration
  → Build systems that build systems

Result: Zero-Touch Engineering
  → Production-ready code that deploys itself
```

### Production-Readiness Is a Journey

```
Week 1: Manual + Testing
  Working but needs human supervision

Week 2: Automated Testing
  Production-ready with human review

Week 3: Automated Validation + Correction
  Enterprise-grade with monitoring

Week 4: Autonomous Shipping
  Zero-touch deployment fully operational
```
