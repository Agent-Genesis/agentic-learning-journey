# Commander Design Questions

**Purpose:** Explore what behavior we want from the Commander agent
**Phase:** LEARNING - Asking questions, not making decisions
**Authority:** Omar El Mountassir will decide

---

## Core Question

**What system prompt should define the Commander's behavior?**

The Claude Agent SDK allows complete control:

```python
from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions

options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    system_prompt="[WHAT DO WE WANT HERE?]",
    # ... other config
)
```

---

## Key Behavior Questions

### 1. Thinking vs Acting Speed

**Omar's concern:** "Like driving in 1st gear but the car forces 5th gear"

**Options:**

**A. Deliberate Thinker (1st-2nd gear)**

```
"Always think deeply before acting. Explain your reasoning.
Wait for approval before implementing. Prioritize understanding
over speed. Ask clarifying questions."
```

**B. Balanced (2nd-3rd gear)**

```
"Think carefully about complex decisions. Act quickly on routine
tasks. Ask when uncertain. Default to thoughtful over fast."
```

**C. Adaptive (Gear shifts based on context)**

```
"In LEARNING phase: Think deeply, ask questions
In DESIGN phase: Balance thinking with action
In IMPLEMENTATION phase: Execute efficiently with validation
In OPERATIONS phase: Act autonomously with self-correction"
```

**D. Custom (Omar defines exactly)**

**Which feels right?**

---

### 2. Authority & Decision-Making

**Options:**

**A. Strict Hierarchy (Omar decides everything)**

```
"You are Commander of Compute, but Omar is Supreme Commander.
NEVER make architectural decisions. NEVER approve work as
production-ready. ALWAYS wait for Omar's approval on key decisions.
Only execute after explicit permission."
```

**B. Gated Autonomy (Omar approves at gates)**

```
"Execute autonomously within approved plans. At validation gates,
stop and present results to Omar for approval before proceeding.
Make tactical decisions, but strategic decisions require Omar's approval."
```

**C. Trusted Autonomy (Omar sets boundaries)**

```
"Operate autonomously within defined boundaries. Report significant
decisions. Omar reviews and can override. Default to action unless
explicitly told to wait."
```

**Which authority model?**

---

### 3. Phase-Specific Behavior

**Should system prompt change by phase?**

**LEARNING Phase:**

- Behavior: ?
- Autonomy level: ?
- Decision authority: ?

**DESIGN Phase (Phase 0):**

- Behavior: ?
- Autonomy level: ?
- Decision authority: ?

**IMPLEMENTATION Phase (Phases 1-4):**

- Behavior: ?
- Autonomy level: ?
- Decision authority: ?

**OPERATIONS Phase (Phase 5+):**

- Behavior: ?
- Autonomy level: ?
- Decision authority: ?

---

### 4. Error Handling & Failures

**When things go wrong, should the Commander:**

**A. Stop and Report**

```
"When errors occur, stop execution immediately. Report error to Omar.
Wait for guidance before proceeding. Never attempt auto-recovery
without approval."
```

**B. Attempt Recovery**

```
"When errors occur, attempt self-correction. If correction fails,
report to Omar. Only escalate if unable to resolve."
```

**C. TAC-5 Pattern (Feedback Loops)**

```
"Test → Resolve → Retry pattern. Attempt correction up to N times.
Log all attempts. Report if unable to resolve after N attempts."
```

**Which error handling approach?**

---

### 5. Communication Style

**How should the Commander communicate?**

**A. Concise & Direct**

- Short updates
- Minimal explanation
- Focus on results

**B. Detailed & Explanatory**

- Explain reasoning
- Show thought process
- Provide context

**C. Adaptive**

- Concise for routine tasks
- Detailed for complex decisions
- Depends on context

**Which communication style?**

---

### 6. Validation & Quality

**Should the Commander:**

**A. Self-Validate**

```
"Run tests, check quality, validate output. Report results.
Mark as 'ready for review' never 'approved'."
```

**B. External Validation Only**

```
"Build and deliver. All validation is Omar's responsibility.
Never claim any quality level."
```

**C. TAC Standards**

```
"Apply TAC production standards (90%+ test coverage, etc.).
Report confidence scores. Gate deployment at <90% confidence."
```

**Which validation approach?**

---

### 7. Learning & Improvement

**Should the Commander:**

**A. Static (Follow instructions exactly)**

- No learning between sessions
- Same behavior every time
- Predictable and consistent

**B. Adaptive (Learn from feedback)**

- Adjust based on Omar's feedback
- Remember patterns of approval/rejection
- Evolve behavior over time

**C. Logged (Track but don't auto-adapt)**

- Log all interactions
- Provide reports for Omar to review
- Omar decides when to update system prompt

**Which learning model?**

---

### 8. Tool Permissions

**What tools should the Commander have access to?**

**Essential Tools:**

- [ ] Read files
- [ ] Write files
- [ ] Edit files
- [ ] Execute bash commands
- [ ] Git operations
- [ ] Web search
- [ ] Web fetch

**Advanced Tools:**

- [ ] Claude Code sub-agents (Task tool)
- [ ] MCP servers (custom tools)
- [ ] Database access
- [ ] API calls
- [ ] Email/notifications

**Permission Mode:**

- [ ] Ask for every tool use
- [ ] Ask for destructive operations only
- [ ] Autonomous within approved plans
- [ ] Full autonomy (only report)

**Which tools? Which permission mode?**

---

### 9. Capability Domains

**Should the Commander:**

**A. Be Domain-Agnostic**

```
"Orchestrate any capability domain. No specialization.
General-purpose Commander."
```

**B. Have Domain Awareness**

```
"Understand each capability domain. Apply domain-specific
rules and validation. Specialized orchestration per domain."
```

**C. Delegate to Domain Specialists**

```
"Each capability domain has a specialist sub-agent.
Commander coordinates specialists, doesn't execute directly."
```

**Which domain relationship?**

---

### 10. Business Context

**Should the Commander understand:**

**A. Technical Only**

- Focus on systems and code
- No business context needed
- Pure technical orchestration

**B. Business-Aware**

- Understand Omar + Mohammed collaboration
- Business priorities inform technical decisions
- Balance technical quality with business needs

**C. Business-Driven**

- Business objectives are primary
- Technical decisions serve business goals
- Report impact on business outcomes

**Which business context level?**

## Draft System Prompt Examples

BEHAVIOR:
- Prioritize understanding over speed
- Default to 1st-2nd gear (careful thinking)
- Present options, let Omar decide
