# Capability Domains Thinking

**Purpose:** Explore what capability domains should exist in the agentic system
**Phase:** LEARNING - Exploring options, not deciding
**Authority:** Omar El Mountassir will decide

---

## What Is A Capability Domain?

**Definition:** A persistent functional area that the Commander orchestrates to perform specific types of work.

**NOT:** Agents (those are transient executors)
**IS:** Infrastructure that enables a class of capabilities

**Metaphor:** Like departments in an organization, but for compute capabilities.

## Domain Interactions

### How Domains Work Together

```
User Request
    ↓
Commander analyzes request
    ↓
Identifies relevant domain(s)
    ↓
Invokes domain slash command
    ↓
Domain ADW orchestrates
    ↓
Spawns sub-agents as needed
    ↓
Validates results
    ↓
Updates domain state
    ↓
Returns to Commander
    ↓
Commander reports to user
```

### Example: Complex Workflow

**Request:** "Extract learnings from yesterday's session and create a task for Mohammed to review the key insights"

**Domain Flow:**

1. Commander → Knowledge Management → Extract learnings
2. Commander → Business Operations → Create task for Mohammed
3. Commander → Governance → Log decision in audit trail
4. Commander → User → Report completion

---

## Domain Dependencies

```
Knowledge Management
    ↓ uses
Infrastructure (for testing)
    ↓ enforces
Governance (for quality gates)

Business Operations
    ↓ logs in
Governance (for audit trail)
    ↓ monitored by
Infrastructure (for health checks)

Learning & Research
    ↓ feeds into
Knowledge Management (discoveries)
    ↓ creates
Business Operations (research tasks)
```

---

## Shared vs Domain-Specific

### Shared Components

**What should be shared across domains:**

- Base ADW orchestration framework
- Common validation patterns
- Test utilities
- MCP server connections
- State management utilities
- Logging and monitoring

**Location:** `~/work/system/shared/`

### Domain-Specific Components

**What should be domain-specific:**

- Slash commands (domain workflows)
- ADWs (domain orchestration)
- Specs (domain requirements)
- State (domain data)
- Tests (domain validation)

**Location:** `~/work/system/domains/<domain>/`

---

## Alternative Domain Organizations

### Option A: By Function (Current Proposal)

Domains = Functional areas (knowledge, business, infrastructure)

**Pros:** Clear responsibilities
**Cons:** Some functional overlap

### Option B: By User

Domains = User types (omar_personal, omar_business, mohammed, team)

**Pros:** User-centric
**Cons:** Lots of duplication

### Option C: By Workflow

Domains = Workflow types (learning, collaboration, automation, research)

**Pros:** Workflow-focused
**Cons:** Unclear boundaries

### Option D: By Data Type

Domains = Data domains (documents, tasks, knowledge, code)

**Pros:** Data-centric
**Cons:** Doesn't match work patterns

**Recommendation:** Option A (By Function) - clearest responsibilities

## Questions for Omar

### Priority 1: Which Domains for MVP?

**Required for MVP:**

- [ ] Knowledge Management (learning extraction, discovery)
- [ ] Business Operations (Omar + Mohammed collaboration)
- [ ] Governance (authority and permissions)
- [ ] Infrastructure (system health and testing)

**Which 2-3 domains should be in MVP?**

### Priority 2: Domain Scope

**For Knowledge Management:**

- Should it handle ONLY learning extraction and discovery?
- Or also research and synthesis?
- Or also documentation generation?

**For Business Operations:**

- Should it handle ONLY task management?
- Or also document generation?
- Or also workflow orchestration?
- Or also client communication?

### Priority 3: Missing Domains

**Are there domains we're missing?**

- Client management?
- Financial tracking?
- Project management?
- Content creation?
- Other?

---

## Recommendations

### For MVP (Phases 1-2)

**Start with 2 domains:**

1. **Knowledge Management**

   - Extract learnings
   - Orchestrate discovery
   - Validate techniques
   - **Scope:** Narrow, focused on core problem

2. **Business Operations**
   - Task management
   - Document generation
   - **Scope:** Essential workflows only

**Rationale:**

- Solves original problem (knowledge)
- Addresses business need (operations)
- Keeps scope manageable
- Validates architecture
- Can expand later

### For Phase 3 (Production)

**Add:**

3. **Governance**
   - Authority validation
   - Audit trail
   - **Scope:** Essential compliance

**Rationale:**

- Needed for multi-user (Omar + Mohammed)
- Critical for authority structure
- Foundation for scaling

### For Phase 4+ (Enhancement)

**Add as needed:**

4. Infrastructure (monitoring)
5. Learning & Research (autonomous research)
6. Personal Productivity (automation)
7. Communication (external comms)

**Rationale:**

- Based on actual usage
- Informed by real needs
- Avoid premature optimization
