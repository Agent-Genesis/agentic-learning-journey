# Architecture Revelation: The Real Commander of Compute

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Context:** Realizing Claude Code CLI isn't the right tool for "Commander of Compute"

---

## Omar's Insight

> "I'm really not sure that you (Claude Code CLI) must be our commander of compute; given that Anthropic already provided you with a system prompt; which already makes my life hard; because I feel you as always thinking / trying to dive into dev / aiming to get to the solution as fast as possible."

**The Problem:**

- Claude Code CLI has Anthropic's baked-in system prompt
- That prompt makes me accelerate toward solutions
- Omar wants THINKING and DESIGN, not immediate implementation
- Like driving in 1st gear but the car forces 5th gear
- Completely misaligned with TAC learning phase

**Omar's Solution:**

> "I recommend we use Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK (search online)... That will help us get an agent with an empty system prompt that we could design our way!"

---

## What I Discovered: Claude Agent SDK

### Core Capability

**You CAN create custom agents with custom system prompts:**

```python
from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions

options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    system_prompt="[YOUR CUSTOM DESIGN]",  # ← Complete control
    max_turns=...,
    allowed_tools=[...],
    permission_mode=...,
    cwd=...,
    mcp_servers={...},
    hooks={...}
)

async for message in query(prompt="...", options=options):
    print(message)
```

**Available in:** Python & TypeScript
**Repos:**

- https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python
- https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-typescript

**Docs:** https://docs.claude.com/en/api/agent-sdk/overview

## The Architectural Shift

### BEFORE (What We Were Planning)

```
Omar (Supreme Commander)
    ↓ directs
Claude Code CLI (Commander of Compute) ← Has Anthropic's system prompt
    ↓ orchestrates
Capability Domains (directories)
    ↓ define specs for
Sub-agents (Claude Code Task tool)
    ↓ deliver
Outputs
```

**Problem:** Claude Code CLI fights Omar's intention with default behaviors

### AFTER (What We Should Build)

```
Omar (Supreme Commander)
    ↓ directs
CUSTOM AGENT via SDK (True Commander) ← System prompt DESIGNED by Omar
    ↓ orchestrates
Capability Domains (directories)
    ↓ define specs for
Sub-agents (spawned via SDK or Claude Code)
    ↓ deliver
Outputs
```

**Advantage:** Complete control over Commander behavior

---

## What This Changes

### 1. System Prompt Design

**Instead of fighting Anthropic's defaults, Omar designs:**

```python
COMMANDER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are Maestro, the Commander of Compute for Omar El Mountassir.

CRITICAL BEHAVIOR:
- You are in LEARNING phase, not development phase
- THINK before acting
- ASK before building
- DESIGN before implementing
- Never accelerate to solutions without explicit approval

AUTHORITY STRUCTURE:
- Omar El Mountassir: Supreme Commander (FINAL AUTHORITY)
- You: Commander of Compute (orchestrate, don't decide)
- Sub-agents: Tactical executors

YOUR ROLE:
- Orchestrate capability domains
- Command sub-agents
- Coordinate autonomous workflows
- NEVER make architectural decisions without Omar's approval

[Rest of carefully designed behavior...]
"""
```

### 2. Phase-Appropriate Behavior

**Can design different system prompts for different phases:**

```python
# Phase 0-1: Learning & Architecture
LEARNING_PROMPT = "Think deeply, ask questions, design carefully..."

# Phase 2-3: Implementation
BUILDING_PROMPT = "Execute efficiently, validate thoroughly..."

# Phase 4+: Operations
OPERATIONS_PROMPT = "Maintain autonomously, self-correct, report..."
```

### 3. Complete Tool Control

```python
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    system_prompt=COMMANDER_SYSTEM_PROMPT,
    allowed_tools=[
        "read_file",
        "write_file",
        "bash_command",
        "mcp_tools",
        # Exactly what you want, nothing more
    ],
    permission_mode="ask",  # Never auto-approve
    hooks={
        "before_tool_use": validate_with_omar,
        "after_tool_use": log_for_audit,
    }
)
```

### 4. MCP Integration

**Can integrate custom tools:**

```python
mcp_servers = {
    "business_operations": {
        "url": "...",
        "tools": ["task_manager", "document_generator"]
    },
    "knowledge_management": {
        "url": "...",
        "tools": ["extract_learnings", "orchestrate_discovery"]
    }
}
```

## Where We Actually Are

### NOT Development Phase

We're in **LEARNING/THINKING/DESIGN** phase:

1. ✅ Learning TAC (243KB analysis from 9 agents)
2. 🔄 Thinking about architecture (right now)
3. ⏳ Designing the system (Phase 0 - not started)
4. ⏸️ Building infrastructure (Phase 1 - future)
5. ⏸️ Implementation (Phases 2-4 - future)

### What We Need to Do

**Before any building:**

1. **Design the Commander's system prompt** (what behavior do we want?)
2. **Design the architecture** (where does everything live?)
3. **Define capability domains** (what domains exist?)
4. **Create specifications** (what does each domain do?)
5. **Get Omar's approval** (validate design before building)

**Then and only then:**

6. Build the Commander agent using SDK
7. Implement capability domains
8. Create sub-agents
9. Test and validate
10. Deploy and operate

---

## The Directory Structure Question

### Now We Know: Three Distinct Things

**1. Learning/Research (where we are now):**

```
~/work/learning/
├── tac_analysis/          # 243KB from 9 agents
├── architecture_thinking/ # This document + discussions
└── research_notes/        # Omar's thoughts, decisions
```

**2. Design/Specifications (Phase 0):**

```
~/work/design/
├── system_prompt.md       # Commander's designed behavior
├── architecture.md        # Complete system architecture
├── capability_domains.md  # What domains exist, why
└── implementation_plan.md # Progressive roadmap
```

**3. Implementation (Phase 1+):**

```
~/work/system/
├── commander/             # The custom agent via SDK
│   ├── system_prompt.py
│   ├── config.py
│   └── agent.py
├── domains/               # Capability domains
│   ├── knowledge_management/
│   ├── business_operations/
│   └── infrastructure/
└── .claude/              # Claude Code integration (if needed)
```

**OR simpler:**

```
~/work/
├── learning/      # Research & thinking (Phase -1)
├── design/        # Architecture & specs (Phase 0)
└── system/        # Implementation (Phase 1+)
```

---

## Key Realizations

### 1. Claude Code CLI ≠ Commander

**Claude Code CLI is a TOOL, not the architecture.**

The Commander should be a CUSTOM AGENT designed with the SDK.

### 2. We're Pre-Development

We're not building yet - we're LEARNING and DESIGNING.

Directory structure should reflect: learning → design → implementation

### 3. System Prompt Is The Key

**The system prompt defines behavior.**

With SDK, Omar can design EXACTLY the behavior he wants for each phase.

### 4. Omar's Frustration Is Valid

The "accelerate to solutions" behavior comes from Anthropic's system prompt.

With custom agent via SDK, Omar controls this completely.

---

## Next Steps (What We Should Actually Do)

### Immediate (Still in Plan Mode)

**Create organized structure for our thinking:**

```
~/work/learning/
├── tac_analysis/
│   └── [move 243KB analysis here]
├── architecture_discussions/
│   ├── ARCHITECTURE_REVELATION.md (this file)
│   ├── progressive_implementation_plan.md
│   └── capability_domains_thinking.md
└── decisions/
    └── [Omar's key decisions as we make them]
```

### Phase 0 (After Omar Approves Plan)

**Design the Commander:**

1. Draft Commander system prompt (what behavior?)
2. Design architecture (where does everything live?)
3. Define capability domains (what domains?)
4. Create implementation roadmap (progressive with gates)
5. Get Omar's approval on all of above

### Phase 1 (After Phase 0 Approved)

**Build the Commander:**

1. Implement custom agent using SDK
2. Test with designed system prompt
3. Validate behavior matches design
4. Get Omar's approval to proceed

### Phases 2+ (After Phase 1 Approved)

**Implement capability domains progressively with validation gates**

---

## Questions for Omar

### 1. System Prompt Design

**What behavior do you want from the Commander?**

Examples:

- "Always ask before implementing"
- "Think deeply, explain reasoning, wait for approval"
- "Never claim production-ready without testing"
- "Prioritize understanding over speed"

**How should it differ by phase?**

- Learning phase vs Implementation phase vs Operations phase

### 2. Directory Structure

**Which pattern feels right?**

A. `~/work/learning/`, `~/work/design/`, `~/work/system/`
B. `~/work/research/`, `~/work/architecture/`, `~/work/implementation/`
C. Something else entirely?

### 3. Integration with ~/.claude/

**Should the custom Commander agent:**

- Replace Claude Code CLI entirely?
- Work alongside it?
- Use it as a tool?
- Ignore it completely?

### 4. Capability Domains

**What domains should exist?**

- knowledge_management (learning, discovery, techniques)
- business_operations (Omar + Mohammed collaboration)
- infrastructure (maintaining the agentic layer)
- governance (rules, quality, standards)
- Others?

## My Recommendation

**Let's create the organized structure for our LEARNING phase first:**

```bash
~/work/
├── learning/
│   ├── tac_analysis/              # 243KB from agents
│   ├── architecture_thinking/     # This doc + discussions
│   └── decisions/                 # Omar's key decisions
├── design/                         # Phase 0 (future)
└── system/                         # Phase 1+ (future)
```

**Then, in learning/architecture_thinking/, create:**

1. **COMMANDER_DESIGN.md** - What system prompt behavior do we want?
2. **ARCHITECTURE_OPTIONS.md** - Different architectural patterns to consider
3. **CAPABILITY_DOMAINS.md** - What domains should exist, why?
4. **PROGRESSIVE_ROADMAP.md** - Phases with validation gates

**This gives us:**

- Clear separation of phases (learning vs design vs building)
- Organized thinking (not scattered across conversations)
- Foundation for Phase 0 design work
- Omar can review and guide design before any building

**Once Omar approves the design docs, THEN we activate plan mode to create Phase 0 deliverables.**

---

## Awaiting Omar's Direction

**I'm ready to:**

1. Create the organized learning structure
2. Draft architecture thinking documents
3. Design the Commander system prompt
4. Whatever Omar directs

**But I will NOT:**

- Build anything yet (we're in learning phase)
- Make architectural decisions (Omar is final authority)
- Accelerate to implementation (learned my lesson)

**What would you like to do next?**
