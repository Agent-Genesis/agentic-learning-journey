# Decision Log

**Purpose:** Track all key architectural and strategic decisions
**Authority:** Omar El Mountassir makes all final decisions
**Format:** Decision NNN with date, context, decision, rationale, status

## Decision 001: Use Claude Agent SDK for Commander

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Context:**

- Claude Code CLI has Anthropic's baked-in system prompt
- That prompt causes "accelerate to solutions" behavior
- Omar wants thoughtful design, not immediate implementation
- Like driving in 1st gear but car forces 5th gear

**Decision:** Build custom Commander agent using Claude Agent SDK with designed system prompt

**Rationale:**

- Claude Agent SDK allows custom system prompts
- Complete control over Commander behavior
- Can design phase-appropriate responses
- Can define authority structure explicitly
- Solves the "accelerator" problem

**Code Pattern:**

```python
from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions

options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    system_prompt="[OMAR'S DESIGNED PROMPT]",  # Complete control
    allowed_tools=[...],
    permission_mode=...,
    # ... Omar's specifications
)
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ Approved by Omar

**Impact:** CRITICAL - Changes entire architectural approach

## Decision 002: Three-Phase Directory Structure

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Context:**

- Need organized workspace for learning ‚Üí design ‚Üí implementation
- Different phases have different purposes
- Clear separation helps maintain focus

**Decision:** Use `~/work/learning/`, `~/work/design/`, `~/work/system/` structure

**Rationale:**

- `learning/` - Learn and think (where we are now)
- `design/` - Design architecture (Phase 0)
- `system/` - Build implementation (Phase 1+)
- Clear phase separation
- Prevents premature implementation
- Aligns with progressive approach

**Structure:**

```
~/work/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ learning/      # LEARNING phase (active)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ design/        # DESIGN phase (future)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ system/        # IMPLEMENTATION phase (future)
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ Approved by Omar

**Impact:** HIGH - Organizes all work

---

## Decision 003: Progressive Implementation Approach

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Context:**

- Need to build agentic system
- Multiple options: start fresh, study more, hybrid, pause, progressive
- Want validation gates to control risk
- Want incremental value delivery

**Decision:** Use Progressive Implementation (Option E) with 5 phases and validation gates

**Rationale:**

- Same total effort as "start fresh" (165 hours)
- But Omar validates at 5 gates before proceeding
- Delivers value earlier (Week 3 vs Week 6+)
- Lower risk (fail fast at any gate)
- Aligns with business thinking (validate before invest)
- Can pivot at any gate if needed

**Phases:**

- Phase 0: Design & Architecture (20h) ‚Üí Gate #1
- Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (30h) ‚Üí Gate #2
- Phase 2: First Domain (30h) ‚Üí Gate #3
- Phase 3: Autonomous Operation (20h) ‚Üí Gate #4
- Phase 4: Second Domain (40h) ‚Üí Gate #5
- Phase 5+: Expansion (ongoing)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Approved by Omar

**Impact:** CRITICAL - Defines how we build

## Decision 004: Capability Domains Model

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Context:**

- Need to organize the agentic system
- Subdirectories ‚â† agents (those are transient)
- Need persistent functional areas
- Need clear metaphor for organization

**Decision:** Use "Capability Domains" model for subdirectories

**Rationale:**

- Capability Domains = persistent functional areas
- Each domain has specific responsibilities
- Like departments in an organization, but for compute
- NOT agents (those are temporary executors)
- NOT managers/directors (those imply people)
- Clear, scalable, TAC-aligned

**Metaphor:**

```
Commander (Claude/Maestro)
    ‚Üì orchestrates
Capability Domains (persistent infrastructure)
    ‚Üì define specs for
Executors (transient Claude Code sub-agents)
    ‚Üì deliver
Outputs (systems/applications)
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ Approved by Omar

**Impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH - Defines organizational model

---

## Decision 005: Start with 2 Domains for MVP

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Context:**

- Need to choose which capability domains to build first
- 7 potential domains identified
- Want manageable MVP scope
- Want to solve real problems

**Decision:** Start with 2 domains - Knowledge Management & Business Operations

**Rationale:**

- Knowledge Management solves original discovery problem
- Business Operations addresses Omar's business with Mohammed
- Both are high-value, high-priority
- Keeps MVP scope manageable
- Validates architecture with two domains
- Can expand later based on real needs

**Domains:**

1. Knowledge Management (learning extraction, discovery, techniques)
2. Business Operations (tasks, documents, workflows for Omar + Mohammed)

**Future domains** (if needed): 3. Governance (authority, permissions, audit) 4. Infrastructure (monitoring, testing, health) 5. Learning & Research (autonomous research) 6. Personal Productivity (automation) 7. Communication (external communications)

**Status:** üîÑ Proposed - Awaiting Omar's final approval

**Impact:** HIGH - Defines initial scope

---

## Decision 006: Separate ~/work/system/ from ~/.claude/

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Context:**

- Need to decide relationship between agentic infrastructure and Claude Code config
- ~/.claude/ contains Claude Code governance
- ~/work/system/ will be agentic infrastructure
- Want to version control ~/work/system/ as git repo

**Decision:** Keep separate - ~/.claude/ for Claude Code config, ~/work/system/ for agentic infrastructure

**Rationale:**

- Clear separation of concerns
- ~/.claude/ = Claude Code tooling configuration
- ~/work/system/ = Agentic infrastructure (repo-friendly)
- Can version control independently
- Can share ~/work/system/ as private GitHub repo
- CLAUDE.md can reference ~/work/system/

**Integration:**

```markdown
# In ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md:

"For agentic operations, see ~/work/system/"
"Commander agent: ~/work/system/maestro"
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ Approved by Omar (2025-10-18)

**Implementation:**
- Created ~/work/ as separate directory from ~/.claude/
- Initialized as git repository
- Version controlling all three phases (learning, design, system)

**Repository:** https://github.com/Agent-Genesis/agentic-system

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Defines infrastructure location

---

## Decision 007: Version Control with Private GitHub Repository

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Context:**
- Need version control for agentic infrastructure
- Want to track learning, design, and implementation phases
- Need shareable private repository for collaboration
- Want professional git workflow

**Decision:** Version control entire ~/work/ directory in private GitHub repository

**Repository Details:**
- Name: `agentic-system`
- URL: https://github.com/Agent-Genesis/agentic-system
- Visibility: Private
- Scope: All three phases (learning/, design/, system/)
- Remote: git@github.com:Agent-Genesis/agentic-system.git

**Rationale:**
- Private repo protects business logic and architecture
- Version control enables collaboration and rollback
- Full history of learning ‚Üí design ‚Üí implementation
- Professional development workflow
- Can share with team members when needed
- Tracks decisions and architecture evolution

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Created .gitignore for runtime state and secrets
# Initialized git repository
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Learning phase complete"

# Created private GitHub repository
gh repo create agentic-system --private --source=. --push
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ Approved by Omar (2025-10-18)

**Impact:** HIGH - Enables version control and collaboration
