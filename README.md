# Work Directory - Agentic System Development

**Current Phase:** LEARNING
**Status:** Architecture thinking complete, awaiting Omar's design decisions
**Purpose:** Build agentic infrastructure using TAC (Tactical Agentic Coding) principles

---

## Three-Phase Structure

This directory organizes work into three progressive phases:

```
~/work/
├── learning/      # LEARNING phase (active)
├── design/        # DESIGN phase (next)
└── system/        # IMPLEMENTATION phase (future)
```

### Phase 1: LEARNING (Current)

**Purpose:** Learn TAC, explore architecture options, think deeply before building

**Location:** `learning/`

**Status:** ✅ Complete - Awaiting Omar's review

**What's there:**

- 243KB of TAC analysis from 9 specialized agents
- 5 architecture thinking documents exploring design options
- Decision log tracking key architectural decisions
- Comprehensive navigation guide

**Key deliverables:**

- [TAC Analysis](learning/tac_analysis/) - Complete exploration of 8 TAC tactics
- [Architecture Thinking](learning/architecture_thinking/) - 5 design exploration documents
- [Decision Log](learning/decisions/DECISION_LOG.md) - All architectural decisions tracked
- [Learning README](learning/README.md) - Navigation guide

**Next:** Omar reviews architecture thinking and answers pending design questions

---

### Phase 2: DESIGN (Next)

**Purpose:** Design complete system architecture with Omar's validation BEFORE building

**Location:** `design/`

**Status:** ⏳ Not started - waiting for Omar's approval to proceed

**What will go there:**

- System architecture documentation
- Commander system prompts (designed for each phase)
- Directory structure specification
- Capability domains specification
- Implementation roadmap with validation gates
- Complete design specifications

**Estimated effort:** 20 hours + Omar's review time

**Validation gate:** Omar must approve design before implementation begins

---

### Phase 3: IMPLEMENTATION (Future)

**Purpose:** Build the agentic system progressively with validation gates

**Location:** `system/`

**Status:** ⏳ Not started - waiting for design approval

**What will go there:**

- Commander agent (built with Claude Agent SDK)
- Capability domains (knowledge_management, business_operations, etc.)
- Shared infrastructure and utilities
- Event hooks and automation
- Tests and validation frameworks
- System documentation

**Implementation plan:** 5 phases with Omar's validation gates

- Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (30h) → Gate #2
- Phase 2: First Domain (30h) → Gate #3
- Phase 3: Autonomous Operation (20h) → Gate #4
- Phase 4: Second Domain (40h) → Gate #5
- Phase 5+: Expansion (ongoing)

**Total estimated effort:** 145 hours across phases 1-5

## Current Status

### What We've Done ✅

1. **Deployed 9 specialized agents** to explore TAC course
2. **Generated 243KB of analysis** covering all 8 tactics
3. **Discovered Claude Agent SDK** enables custom Commander with custom system prompts
4. **Created 5 architecture thinking documents** exploring design options
5. **Organized learning materials** into clean structure
6. **Logged key decisions** with rationale and status

### What We're Doing Now 🔄

- Presenting architecture thinking to Omar for review
- Awaiting Omar's decisions on 7 pending questions
- Ready to move to DESIGN phase when Omar approves

### What's Next ⏳

**After Omar reviews learning phase:**

1. **Answer pending design questions** (Commander behavior, directory structure, domains, etc.)
2. **Move to DESIGN phase** (Phase 0)
3. **Create detailed design specifications** based on Omar's decisions
4. **Get Omar's approval** on complete design
5. **Then and only then** move to implementation

**We will NOT build anything until design is approved.**

## Key Insights from Learning Phase

### 1. Claude Code CLI ≠ Commander

**Problem:** Claude Code CLI has Anthropic's system prompt causing "accelerator" behavior

- Makes me rush to solutions
- Like driving in 1st gear but car forces 5th gear

**Solution:** Use Claude Agent SDK with custom system prompts

- Complete control over Commander behavior
- Phase-appropriate responses
- Designed exactly as Omar wants

### 2. Scripts ≠ Systems

**What I built:** 5 Python scripts (application logic)

**What TAC requires:** Agentic infrastructure

- Slash commands orchestrating agents
- ADWs (Agentic Dispatch Workflows)
- Specifications and state
- Event-driven automation
- Self-correction loops

**Gap:** CRITICAL - need to build the infrastructure, not just applications

### 3. Progressive > Big Bang

**Progressive approach wins:**

- 5 phases with Omar's validation gates
- Delivers value incrementally (Week 3, Week 4, Week 6)
- Lower risk (fail fast at any gate)
- Same total effort (165 hours)

### 4. We're in LEARNING, Not Development

**Current phase:** Thinking, exploring, learning
**Next phase:** Designing with Omar's input
**Future phase:** Building (only after design approved)

**Premature implementation = wasted effort**

## The Vision

**What we're building:**

An agentic infrastructure where:

- **Commander** (Claude/Maestro via SDK) orchestrates work
- **Capability Domains** provide persistent functional areas
- **Sub-agents** (transient) execute specific tasks
- **Systems build systems** (TAC principle)
- **50% time** invested in agentic layer, not just applications

**Immediate value:**

- Knowledge Management: Extract learnings, discover techniques
- Business Operations: Task management, document generation, workflows

**Long-term vision:**

- Autonomous operation with minimal Omar intervention
- Self-correcting with quality gates
- Scalable across multiple domains
- Production-ready with 90%+ test coverage

## Authority Structure

**Supreme Commander:** Omar El Mountassir (FINAL AUTHORITY)

- Makes all final decisions
- Approves all phase transitions
- Reviews all design choices

**Commander of Compute:** Claude/Maestro (student in training)

- Currently in LEARNING phase
- Building understanding before building systems
- Awaiting Omar's direction and approval

## Questions for Omar (Outstanding)

2. Which authority model? (strict/gated/trusted)
3. Should system prompt change by phase?
4. Which error handling approach?
5. Which communication style?
6. Which validation approach?
7. Tool permissions and mode?

### From Directory Architecture (3 questions)

1. Which directory structure (Options A-F)?
2. Separate from or integrate with ~/.claude/?
3. Should ~/work/system/ be a git repo?

### From Capability Domains (3 questions)

1. Which domains for MVP (2-3 domains)?
2. Domain scope for each?
3. Any missing domains?

### From Implementation Plan (3 questions)

1. Does progressive approach make sense?
2. Is 6-week timeline realistic?
3. Are success metrics correct?

**All questions detailed in:** [learning/architecture_thinking/](learning/architecture_thinking/)

## Timeline (If Approved)

```
Week 1:  Phase 0 (Design) → Gate #1: Omar approves design
Week 2:  Phase 1 (Infrastructure) → Gate #2: Omar tests infra
Week 3:  Phase 2 (First Domain) → Gate #3: Omar uses system
Week 4:  Phase 3 (Automation) → Gate #4: Omar observes automation
Week 5-6: Phase 4 (Second Domain) → Gate #5: Omar + Mohammed use
Week 7+: Phase 5+ (Expansion) → Ongoing improvement
```

**Earliest useful value:** Week 3 (working knowledge management)
**Full 2-domain system:** Week 6
**Continuous expansion:** Ongoing based on needs
